<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The history of jurisprudence is the history of civilization.
The labors of the lawgiver embody not only the
manners and customs of his time, but also its innermost
thoughts and beliefs, laid bare for our examination with a
frankness that admits of no concealment. These afford
the surest outlines for a trustworthy picture of the past,
of which the details are supplied by the records of the
chronicler.</p>

<p>It is from these sources that I have attempted, in the
present work, a brief investigation into the group of laws
and customs through which our forefathers sought to discover
hidden truth when disputed between man and man.
Not only do these throw light upon the progress of
human development from primitive savagism to civilized
enlightenment, but they bring into view some of the
strangest mysteries of the human mind.</p>

<p>In this edition I have endeavored to indicate, more
clearly than before, the source, in prehistoric antiquity,
of some of the superstitions which are only even now
slowly dying out among us, and which ever and anon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
reassert themselves under the thin varnish of our modern
rationalism.</p>

<p>In a greatly condensed form the first three essays
originally appeared in the North American Review.</p>

<p class="pdate">
June, 1878.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although in the revision of this volume for a fourth
edition there has not been found much to alter, considerable
additions have been made which render the
survey of the subject more complete. In revising the
essays on the Wager of Battle and the Ordeal I have
had the advantage of the labors of two recent writers,
Dr. Patetta, whose “Le Ordalie” is an extended and
philosophical investigation into the whole topic of the
Judgments of God, and George Neilson, Esq., whose
“Trial by Combat” is a complete account, from the
original sources, of the history of the judicial duel in
Great Britain. Mr. Neilson has also had the courtesy
to communicate to me the results of his further studies
of the subject. I therefore indulge the hope that the
present edition will be found more worthy of the favor
with which the work has been received.</p>

<small>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE KINDRED.</small></h3>


<p>The conception of crime as a wrong committed against
society is too abstract to find expression in the institutions of
uncivilized communities. The slayer or the spoiler is an
enemy, not of his fellows in general, but only of the sufferer
or of his kindred; and if society can provide means for the
wronged to exact reparation, it has done its duty to the utmost,
and has, indeed, made a notable advance on the path that leads
from barbarism to civilization. How recent has been our progress
beyond this stage of development is illustrated in the provisions
of a code granted so lately as 1231 by the Abbey of St.
Bertin to the town of Arques. By these laws, when a man
was convicted of intentional homicide, he was handed over to
the family of the murdered person, to be slain by them in turn.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
It still was vengeance, and not justice, that was to be satisfied.</p>

<p>In early times, therefore, the wrong-doer owed no satisfaction
to the law or to the state, but only to the injured party. That
injured party, moreover, was not a mere individual. All the
races of the great Aryan branch of mankind have developed
through a common plan of organization, in which each family—sometimes
merely the circle of near kindred, at others enlarged
into a <i>gens</i> or sept—was a unit with respect to the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
similar aggregations in the tribe or nation, presenting, with
respect to personal rights, features analogous to their communal
holding of land.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Within these units, as a general rule, each
individual was personally answerable for all, and all were
answerable for each. A characteristic incident of this system
was the <i>wer-gild</i> or blood-money, through which offences were
condoned and the aggrieved were satisfied by a payment made,
when the crime was homicide, to the kindred of the slain, and
generally contributed by the kindred of the slayer.</p>

<p>The fragments of the Avesta are the earliest records of Aryan
legislation that have reached us, and in them we find distinctly
marked evidence of this common responsibility of the kindred.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Among the Hindus, the ancient code, known as the Manava
Dharma Sastra, represents a highly complex social organization,
in which primitive institutions have been completely overlaid
by the later and antagonistic elements of caste and Brahmanism,
but yet it reveals the existence of village communities
which were a direct development of the primal system of the
family;<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and the ancient solidarity of these communities is
shown in the provision that if a murder or robbery could not
be traced, the village in which it occurred was obliged to make
it good, or that to which the track of the offender could be
followed.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> In the adventures of the Kauravas and Pandavas,
moreover, the Mahabharata preserves fragments of traditions
conveying some indications of a pre-existing solidarity among
kindred.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Much more clearly defined were the Hellenic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
organizations of the <i>patræ</i> and <i>phratriæ</i>; while the institution
of the <i>wer-gild</i> is seen in the wages earned by Heracles in
serving Omphale, to be paid to the kinsmen of the murdered
Iphitus; and its existence can be traced to historic times in the
payments provided by the Trallian laws to the families of the
subject Leleges and Minyans who might be slain. Sir Henry
Maine has acutely suggested, also, that the belief in an hereditary
curse, which plays so awful a part in Grecian legend, is
derived from the primal idea of the solidarity of the family
group.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> In Rome, notwithstanding the powerful Latin tendency
to absorb all minor subdivisions into the state, the institution
of the <i>gens</i>, and the relationship between the patron and
his clients, bear striking analogies to the organizations which
we find among the Teutonic tribes as they emerge into history;
while the fine imposed on the elder Horatius, to expiate for
his son the crime of slaying his sister, shows a remnant still
existing of the <i>wer-gild</i> levied on the relatives.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The early
legislation of the Celts, both in the Irish and Welsh tribes, as
we shall presently see, carried the solidarity of the family to
its highest point of development. The same institutions form
a prominent feature of social organization among the Slavs.
The Russian Mir, or communal society, is evidently a development
of the original family; while the Ruskaia Prawda, the
earliest extant code, promulgated by Yaroslav Vladomirovich
in the eleventh century, allows the relatives of a murdered
man either to kill the murderer or to accept a <i>wer-gild</i> from
him. The district, moreover, in which a homicide occurs is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
liable to a fine, unless the victim is an unknown stranger: as
such, there are none to claim compensation for him, he is outside
of all family organization, and the law has no protection
for him.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> In Poland, the laws in force until the close of the
fifteenth century provided no other penalty for murder than a
<i>wer-gild</i> to be divided among the kindred and friends of the
slain; and during the fifteenth century there was only a short
term of imprisonment added.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Among the southern Slavs the
Zadruga takes the place of the Russian Mir, and is a still more
absolute and primitive form of family organization.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>In obedience to this all-pervading tendency of organization,
the barbarian tribes which overthrew the Roman Empire based
their institutions on two general principles—the independence
of the individual freeman and the solidarity of the family
group—and on these were founded their simple forms of jurisprudence.
As the criminal was not responsible to the state,
but to the injured party, personal punishments were unknown,
and the law made no attempt to decree them. All that it
could do was to provide rude courts before which a plaintiff
could state his case, and a settled tariff of pecuniary compensation
to console him for his sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> If he disdained this
peaceful process, he was at liberty to assemble his kindred and
friends, and exact what satisfaction he could with sword and
axe. The offender, moreover, could not legitimately refuse to
appear when summoned before the <i>mallum</i>, or judicial assembly
of the tribe; nor could he, as a rule, claim the right of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
armed defence, if the complainant preferred to receive the
money payment provided for the offence of which he might
prove his antagonist guilty.</p>

<p>This <i>wer-gild</i> was in no sense a fine inflicted as a punishment
for guilt, but only a compensation to induce the injured
party to forego his right of reprisals, and the interest which
society felt in it was not in the repression of crime, but in the
maintenance of peace by averting the endless warfare of hostile
families. An Anglo-Saxon proverb, quoted approvingly in the
laws of Edward the Confessor, as collected by William the
Conqueror, says: “Bicge spere of side oðer bere”—Buy off
the spear from thy side or endure it.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The application of the
system is to be seen in the minute and complex tariffs of crime
which form so large a portion of the barbarian codes. Every
attempt against person and property is rated at its appropriate
price, from the theft of a sucking pig to the armed occupation
of an estate, and from a wound of the little finger to the most
atrocious of parricides. To what extent this at last was carried
may be seen in the Welsh codes, where every hair of the
eyelash is rated at a penny.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>This system introduced into legal proceedings a commercial
spirit which seems strangely at variance with the savage heroism
commonly attributed to our barbarian ancestors. In the translation
by Mr. Dasent of the old Icelandic Saga of Burnt Njal
is vividly set forth the complex procedure which arose from
the development of these principles, whereby suits could be
sold and assigned by one party to another, and a plaintiff with
a promising claim for damages would part with it to some
speculator who undertook the chances of the suit; or, if the
prospects were not encouraging, he would pay some shrewd
lawyer or mighty warrior to prosecute it in his stead. As
either party in the primitive Icelandic code could at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
moment interrupt the proceedings with a challenge to single
combat, or a powerful pleader might collect his friends for a
raid on the Althing, and thus break up the court, this traffic in
suits was a speculation well fitted to vary the monotony of a
sea-rover’s life on shore.</p>

<p>In the application of this principle of compensation the
solidarity of the family bore a part as conspicuous as in the
alternative of private warfare. The kindred of the offender
were obliged to contribute shares proportionate to their degrees
of relationship; while those of the man who was wronged
received respective percentages calculated on the same basis.
Thus the most ancient Barbarian code that has reached us—that
of the Feini, or primitive Irish—in a fanciful quadripartite
enumeration of the principles in force in levying fines,
alludes to the responsibility of kindred—“And because there
are four things for which it is levied: ‘cin’ (one’s own crime),
and ‘tobhach’ (the crime of a near kinsman), ‘saighi’ (the
crime of a middle kinsman), and the crime of a kinsman in
general.”<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> A very complete example of the development of
this system is to be found in the Icelandic legislation of the
twelfth century, where the fines exacted diminish gradually, as
far as the relatives in the fifth degree on both sides, each grade
of the criminal’s family paying its rate to the corresponding
grade of the sufferer’s kindred.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> When, however, the next of
kin were females, and were thus incompetent to prosecute for
murder, the person who undertook that office was rewarded
with one-third of the fine.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> It was not until about 1270 that
King Haco, in his unsuccessful attempt to reform these laws,
ventured to decree that in cases of murder the blood-money
should not be divided among the family of the victim, but
should all be paid to the heir.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> On the other hand, in Denmark,
Eric VII., in 1269, relieved the kindred of the murderer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
from contributing to the <i>wer-gild</i>, although it continued to be
divided among the relatives of the slain.<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Among the Welsh the provisions for levying and distributing
the fines were almost as complex as those of the early
Icelandic law, one body of jurisprudence extending the liability
even as far as sixth cousins;<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and perhaps the quaintest
expression of the responsibility of the kindred is to be found
in the regulation that if any one should draw blood from the
abbot of either of the seven great houses of Dyved, the offender
should forfeit seven pounds, while a female of his kindred
should become a washerwoman in token of disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The
firm hold which this practical solidarity of the family had
upon the jurisprudence of the European races is shown by a
clause in the statutes of the city of Lille, as late as the fourteenth
century, where the malefactor had the right to collect
from his relatives a portion of the <i>wer-gild</i> which he had incurred;
and elaborate tables were drawn up, showing the
amount payable by each relative in proportion to his degree
of kinship, the liability extending as far as to third cousins.<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
A still more pregnant example of the responsibility of kindred
is found in the customs of Aspres, in 1184, where the kindred
of a homicide, if they would abjure him by oath on relics,
were entitled to the public peace; but, if they refused to do
so, it became the duty of the Count of Hainault, the Abbot of
St. Vaast, and the relatives of the slain, to hunt them down,
and seize all their property.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The introduction of Christianity, with the all-pervading
sacerdotalism of the church, rendered necessary an innovation
on the primeval form of social organization, for ecclesiastical
ties dissolved those of the family. By the Carlovingian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
legislation, when a priest was slain his <i>wer-gild</i> was paid to
the church, which was held to be nearer to him than any relative,<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
though this regulation subsequently was modified so as
to divide the composition into three parts, of which one was
paid to the church of the deceased, one to his bishop, and the
third to his kindred.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> As a general rule, therefore, the clerk
could claim no share of the blood-money collected for the
murder of his kinsmen; nor be called upon to contribute to
that incurred by his family;<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> though it is true that, by the
Welsh laws of Hoel the Good, compiled in the tenth century,
children, even prospective, were a link through which the
liability might be again incurred. “Neither clerks nor women
are to have a share of the <i>galanas</i>, since they are not avengers;
however, they are to pay for their children or to make oath
that they shall never have any.”<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>With this exception, therefore, in its relations to the community,
each family in the barbaric tribes was a unit, both for
attack and defence, whether recourse was had to the jealously
preserved right of private warfare, or whether the injured parties
contented themselves with the more peaceful processes of
the <i>mallum</i> or <i>althing</i>. This solidarity of the kindred is the
key to much that would otherwise appear irrational in their
legislation, and left, as we have seen, its traces late in the
customary law.</p>

<small>THE OATH AND ITS ACCESSORIES.</small></h3>


<p>Between the commission of an offence and its proof in a
court of justice there lies a wide field for the exercise or perversion
of human ingenuity. The subject of evidence is one
which has taxed man’s reasoning powers to the utmost; and
the subtle distinctions of the Roman law, with its <i>probatio</i>,
<i>præsumptio juris</i>, <i>præsumptio juris tantum</i>: the endless refinements
of the glossators, rating evidence in its different
grades, as <i>probatio optima</i>, <i>evidentissima</i>, <i>apertissima</i>, <i>legitima</i>,
<i>sufficiens</i>, <i>indubitata</i>, <i>dilucida</i>, <i>liquida</i>, <i>evidens</i>, <i>perspicua</i>,
and <i>semiplena</i>; and the artificial rules of the common law, so
repugnant frequently to human common sense, all alike show
the importance of the subject, and its supreme difficulty. The
semi-barbarian, impatient of such expenditure of logic, arrived
at results by a shorter process.</p>

<p>The time has passed for the romantic school of writers who
assume that the unsupported oath of the accused was originally
sufficient to clear him of a charge, when the fierce warrior disdained
to shrink from the consequences of his act. It was
not, indeed, until long after the Teutonic tribes had declined
from the assumed virtues of their native forests, that an unsupported
oath was receivable as evidence, and the introduction
of such a custom may be traced to the influence of the Roman
law, in which the importance of the oath was overwhelming.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
The Wisigoths, who moulded their laws on the Roman jurisprudence,
were the only race of barbarians who permitted the
accused, in the absence of definite testimony, to escape on his
single oath,<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and this exception only tends to prove the rule,
for at the council of Valence, in 855, the Wisigothic custom
was denounced in the strongest terms as an incentive to perjury.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
It is true that the oath of a master could clear a slave
accused of certain crimes,<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> which was no less an incentive to
perjury, for the master was liable in case of conviction, but
presumably in such case he took upon himself the responsibility
and laid himself open to an accusation of perjury. As
a rule, however, we may assume that the purgatorial power of
a single oath was an innovation introduced by the church,
which was trained in the Roman institutions and claimed for
its members the privilege, when testimony was deficient, of
clearing themselves by appealing in this manner to God.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
Continued contact with the remains of Roman civilization
strengthened the custom, and its development was to a great
extent due to the revival of the study of the imperial jurisprudence
in the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The primitive principle is well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
expressed in the Frisian code, where the pleader says, “I
swear alone, if thou darest, deny my oath and fight me,”<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
where the oath is only the preliminary to proof by the judgment
of God.</p>

<p>The exceptions to this in the early legislation of the barbarians
are merely special immunities bestowed on rank.
Thus in one of the most primitive of the Anglo-Saxon codes,
which dates from the seventh century, the king and the bishop
are permitted to rebut an accusation with their simple asseveration,
and the thane and the mass-priest with a simple oath,
while the great body both of clerks and laymen are forced to
clear themselves by undergoing the regular form of canonical
compurgation which will be hereafter described.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> So, in the
Welsh legislation, exemption from the oath of absolution was
accorded to bishops, lords, the deaf, the dumb, men of a
different language, and pregnant women.<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Instances of class-privileges
such as these may be traced throughout the whole
period of the dark ages, and prove nothing except the
advantages claimed and enjoyed by caste. Thus, by the law
of Southern Germany, the unsupported oath of a claimant
was sufficient, if he were a person of substance and repute,
while, if otherwise, he was obliged to provide two conjurators,<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
and in Castile, the <i>fijodalgo</i>, or noble, could rebut a claim in
civil cases by taking three solemn oaths, in which he invoked
on himself the vengeance of God in this world and the next.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>So far, indeed, were the Barbarians from reposing implicit
confidence in the integrity of their fellows that their earliest
records show how fully they shared in the common desire of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
mankind to place the oath under the most efficient guarantees
that ingenuity could devise. In its most simple form the oath
is an invocation of some deity or supernatural power to grant
or withhold his favor in accordance with the veracity of the
swearer, but at all times men have sought to render this more
impressive by interposing material objects dear to the individual,
which were understood to be offered as pledges or
victims for the divine wrath. Thus, among the Hindus,
the ancient Manava Dharma Sastra prescribes the oath as
satisfactory evidence in default of evidence, but requires it to
be duly reinforced—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In cases where there is no testimony, and the judge cannot
decide upon which side lies the truth, he can determine it
fully by administering the oath.</p>

<p>“Oaths were sworn by the seven Maharshis, and by the
gods, to make doubtful things manifest, and even Vasishtha
sware an oath before the king Sudama, son of Piyavana, when
Viswamitra accused him of eating a hundred children.</p>

<p>“Let not the wise man take an oath in vain, even for things
of little weight; for he who takes an oath in vain is lost in
this world and the next.</p>

<p>“Let the judge swear the Brahman by his truth; the Kshatriya
by his horses, his elephants, or his arms; the Vaisya by
his cows, his corn, and his gold; the Sudra by all crimes.”<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And in the more detailed code of Vishnu there is an exceedingly
complicated system of objects to be sworn upon,
varying with the amount at stake and the caste of the swearer.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>We see the same custom in Greece, where Homer represents
Hera as exculpating herself by an oath on the sacred
head of Zeus, and on their marriage-bed, a practice which
mortals imitated by swearing on the heads of their children,
or on that of their patron, or of the king.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Under the Roman
law, oaths were frequently taken on the head of the litigant,
or on those of his children.<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The Norse warrior was sworn,
like the Hindu Kshatriya, on his warlike gear:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oaths shalt thou</div>
<div class="verse">First to me swear,</div>
<div class="verse">By board of ship,</div>
<div class="verse">By rim of shield,</div>
<div class="verse">By shoulder of steed,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">By edge of sword,</div>
<div class="verse">That thou wilt not slay</div>
<div class="verse">The wife of Volund,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor of my bride</div>
<div class="verse">Cause the death.”<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When these material pledges were not offered, the sanctions
of religion have in all ages been called into play to impress
the imagination of the swearer with the awful responsibility
incurred, the presence of the deity being obtained by the
offer of a sacrifice, or his interposition being assured by the
use of some object of peculiar sacredness. In Deuteronomy,
when the corpse of a murdered man was found, the elders of
the nearest city disculpated themselves and their fellow-citizens
before the Levites over the body of a heifer slain for the
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> We see the same principle applied to promissory
oaths in the horse which Tyndareus sacrificed and buried
when he exacted from the suitors of Helen the oath that they
would accede to her choice of a bridegroom and defend her
and her husband against all comers;<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and it is only necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to allude to the well-known Ara Maxima of Hercules in Rome
to show the prevalence of the same customs among the Italiotes.
Similar practices were familiar to the Norsemen.
Among them the Godi was both priest and judge, the judgment-seat
adjoined the temple, and all parties to a suit,
including judge and witnesses, were solemnly sworn upon the
sacred ring kept for that purpose on the altar. It was sprinkled
with the blood of a sacrificial bull, and then the oath
was taken by invoking Freyr and Niord, and the almighty As
to help the swearer as he should maintain truth and justice.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Yet so little did all these precautions serve to curb the
untruthfulness of the cunning sea-kings that in Viga-Glums
Saga we find Glum denying a charge of murder by an oath
taken in three temples, in which he called Odin to witness in
words so craftily framed that while he was in reality confessing
his guilt he apparently was denying it most circumstantially.<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>Similarly in Christian times, the most venerated forms of
religion were, from a very early period, called in to lend
sanctity to the imprecation, by devices which gave additional
solemnity to the awful ceremony. In this the natural tendency
of the church to follow the traditional customs of the populations
from which its members were drawn was reinforced by
the example of the practices of Judaism. The “covenant
between the pieces,” by which Yahveh confirmed his promises
to Abram, and by which the Jews renewed their promises to
him, was a sacrificial ceremony of the most impressive character,
only to be used on occasions of supreme importance.
As soon as a permanent place of worship was provided, the
altar in the temple was resorted to by litigants in order that
the oath might be taken in the presence of Yahveh himself;
and so powerful was the impression of this upon the Christian
mind that in the early ages of the church there was a popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
superstition that an oath taken in a Jewish synagogue was
more binding and more efficient than one taken elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
These beliefs developed into a great variety of formulas,
which would reward an examination more detailed than that
which I can give them here.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixth century, Pope Pelagius I. did
not disdain to absolve himself from the charge of having been
concerned in the troubles which drove his predecessor Vigilius
into exile, by taking a disculpatory oath in the pulpit, holding
over his head a crucifix and the gospels;<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and in the eighth
century a priest accused without witnesses to prove his guilt
was enabled to absolve himself by placing the cross upon his
head and declaring his innocence by the Everlasting God.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> So,
when the holy Gregory of Tours was accused of reproachful
words truly spoken of Queen Fredegonda, a council of bishops
decided that he should clear himself of the charge by oaths
on three altars, after celebrating mass on each, which he duly
performed, doubtless more to his corporeal than his spiritual
benefit.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> This plan of reduplicating oaths on different altars
was an established practice among the Anglo-Saxons, who, in
certain cases, allowed the plaintiff to substantiate his assertion
by swearing in four churches, while the defendant could
rebut the charge by taking an oath of negation in twelve.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
Seven altars are similarly specified in the ancient Welsh laws
in cases where a surety desired to deny his suretyship;<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and,
according to the <i>Fleta</i>, as late as the thirteenth century, a
custom was current among merchants of proving the payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of a debt by swearing in nine churches, the abuse of which
led to its abrogation.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>The intense veneration with which relics were regarded,
however, caused them to be generally adopted as the most
effective means of adding security to oaths, and so little respect
was felt for the simple oath that, ere long, the adjuncts
came to be looked upon as the essential feature, and the imprecation
itself to be divested of binding force without them.
Thus, in 680, when Ebroin, mayor of the palace of Burgundy,
had defeated Martin, Duke of Austrasia, and desired to entice
him from his refuge in the stronghold of Laon, two bishops
were sent to him bearing the royal reliquaries, on which they
swore that his life should be safe. Ebroin, however, had
astutely removed the holy remains from their cases in advance,
and when he thus got his enemy in his power, he held it but
a venial indiscretion to expose Martin to a shameful death.<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
How thoroughly this was in accordance with the ideas of the
age is shown by the incorporation, in the canons of the church,
of the doctrine that an oath was to be estimated by its externals
and not by itself. The penitential of David, dating
from the latter half of the sixth century, provides that perjury
committed in a church shall be punished by a fine of four
times the value of that for which the false oath was taken,<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> but
no penalty is provided for false swearing elsewhere. As the
theory developed itself this tacit condoning of such perjury
was boldly declared to be good ecclesiastical law, and the
venerable code of morality which passes under the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury assumes that a false oath
taken on a consecrated cross requires, for absolution, three
times the penance necessary in cases where the oath had been
taken on an unconsecrated one, while, if the ministration of a
priest had not been employed, the oath was void, and no
penalty was inflicted for its violation.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> In a similar mood
the penitential known as that of Gregory III. provides that
three years’ penance will absolve for perjury committed on
a consecrated cross or on the hand of a bishop or priest, while
seven years are requisite if the oath has been taken on the
gospels or on an altar with relics.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> This rule took its final
shape in the canon law, which provides one year’s penance for
perjury committed on an unconsecrated cross, and three years’
for that on a consecrated one, or on the hand of a bishop.<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>These principles were adopted as the fundamental basis of
all legal procedures in Wales. Every prosecution and defence
required relics to give validity to the oaths of both parties, and
even in the fifteenth century a collection of laws declares that
a plaintiff coming into court without a relic on which to make
his oath, not only lost his cause, but incurred a fine of nine-score
pence. The same tendency is shown in the rule by which
a man who suspected another of theft could go to him with a
relic, and in the presence of witnesses demand an oath of negation,
a failure in which was a conviction of the crime im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>puted,
without further trial.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> In the same spirit, ecclesiastical
authority was even found to admit that a powerful motive might
extenuate the sin of perjury. If committed voluntarily, seven
years of penitence were enjoined for its absolution; if involuntarily,
sixteen months, while if to preserve life or limb, the
offence could be washed out with four months.<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> When such
doctrines were received and acted upon, we can hardly wonder
at the ingenious device which the sensitive charity of King
Robert the Pious imitated from the duplicity of Ebroin, to save
the souls of his friends. He provided two reliquaries on which
to receive their oaths—one for his magnates, splendidly fabricated
of crystal and gold, but entirely empty, the other for the
common herd, plainer and enshrining a bird’s egg. Knowing
in advance that his lieges would be forsworn, he thus piously
sought to save them from sin in spite of themselves, and his
monkish panegyrist is delighted in recounting this holy deceit.<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>It was easy, from a belief such as this, to draw the deduction
that when an oath was sworn on relics of peculiar sanctity,
immediate punishment would follow perjury; and thus it
followed that some shrines obtained a reputation which caused
them to be resorted to in the settlement of disputed judicial
questions. Even as early as St. Augustin there are traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
such practices, which that Father of the Church not only records,
but imitated,<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and at a later period the legends are
numerous which record how the perjured sinner was stricken
down senseless or rendered rigid and motionless in the act of
swearing falsely.<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> From this point of view oaths were really
ordeals, and as such we shall consider them hereafter. At present
it suffices to observe that the profit which the church derived
from thus administering oaths on relics affords an easy
explanation of her teachings, and of the extension of these
practices. Their resultant advantages are well illustrated by
the example of the holy taper of Cardigan, in Wales. A
miraculous image of the Virgin was cast ashore, bearing this
taper burning in its hand. A church was built for it, and
the taper “contynued styll burnynge the space of nyne yeres,
without wastynge, until the tyme that one forsware himselfe
thereon, so then it extincted, and never burned after.” At
the suppression of the house under Henry VIII., the prior,
Thomas Hore, testified: “Item, that since the ceasynge of
burnynge of the sayd taper, it was enclosed and taken for a
greate relyque, and so worshipped and kyssed of pylgremes,
and used of men to sweare by in difficill and harde matters,
whereof the advauntage admounted to greate sommes of money
in tymes passed, payenge yerely to the same XXti nobles for a
pencion unto thabbott of Chersey.”<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>In all this Spain would seem to be exceptional. In the
thirteenth century the rule is expressed that a pleader must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
take the oath required of him by his antagonist; if he is required
to swear by God, it will not suffice for him to swear by
some saint, or by his own head. Oaths could indeed be taken
on crosses or altars, but they could also be reduced to the
simplest asseveration. Thus, there is a provision that if one
party says “Swear to me on your simple word,” then the reply
“know that it is so,” or “believe me that it is so,” suffices,
and has all the force of the most solemn adjuration.<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<small>CONJURATORS, OR PARTAKERS IN THE OATH.</small></h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the earnestness with which these teachings
were enforced, it may readily be believed that the wild barbarian,
who was clamoring for the restoration of stolen cattle,
or the angry relatives, eager to share the <i>wer-gild</i> of some
murdered kinsman, would scarce submit to be balked of
their rights at the cost of simple perjury on the part of the
criminal. We have seen that both before and after their conversion
to Christianity they had little scruple in defiling the
most sacred sanctions of the oath with cunning fraud, and
they could repose little confidence in the most elaborate
devices which superstition could invent to render perjury
more to be dreaded than defeat. It was therefore natural that
they should perpetuate an ancestral custom, which had arisen
from the structure of their society, and which derived its
guarantee from the solidarity of families alluded to above.
This was the custom which was subsequently known as canonical
compurgation, and which long remained a part of
English jurisprudence, under the name of the Wager of Law.
The defendant, when denying the allegation under oath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
appeared surrounded by a number of companions—<i>juratores</i>,
<i>conjuratores</i>, <i>sacramentales</i>, <i>collaudantes</i>, <i>compurgatores</i>, as
they were variously termed—who swore, not to their knowledge
of the facts, but as sharers and partakers in the oath of
denial.</p>

<p>This form of procedure derives importance from the fact
that it is an expression of the character, not of an isolated
sept, but of nearly all the races that have moulded the destinies
of modern Europe. Although unknown to the Roman
law, there are traces of it in the ancient Hellenic legislation.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
The Ostrogoths in Italy, and the Wisigoths of the south of
France and Spain were the only nations in whose extant codes
it occupies no place, and they, as has already been remarked,
at an early period yielded themselves completely to the influence
of the Roman civilization.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> On the other hand, the
Salians, the Ripuarians, the Alamanni, the Baioarians, the
Lombards, the Frisians, the Norsemen, the Saxons, the Angli
and Werini, the Anglo-Saxons, and the Welsh, races whose
common origin must be sought in the prehistoric past, all gave
to this form of purgation a prominent position in their jurisprudence,
and it may be said to have reigned from Southern
Italy to Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The earliest text of the Salic law presents us with the usages
of the Franks unaltered by any allusions to Christianity, and
it may therefore be presumed to date from a period not later
than the conversion of Clovis. In this primitive code there
are directions for the employment of conjurators, which show
that the procedure was a settled and established form at that
period.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> So in the Frisian law, which, although compiled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the eighth century, still reveals pagan customs and the primitive
condition of society, the practice of compurgation
evidently forms the basis of judicial proceedings. The
Islands Landnamabok also exhibits it as a form of regular
procedure among the heathen Norsemen. Although the other
codes have only reached us in revisions subsequent to the
conversion of the several tribes, still, the universal use of the
practice shows that its origin must be traced to a period
anterior to the separation of the several races from the original
common stock.</p>

<p>The church, with the tact which distinguished her dealings
with her new converts, was not long in adopting a system
which was admirably suited for her defence in an age of brute
force. As holy orders sundered all other ties, and as the
church was regarded as one vast family, ecclesiastics speedily
arrogated to themselves and obtained the privilege of having
men of their own class as compurgators, and, thus fortified
for mutual support, they were aided in resisting the oppressors
who invaded their rights on every hand. This claim, with
all its attendant advantages, was fully conceded when Charlemagne,
in the year 800, went to Rome for the purpose of
trying Pope Leo III. on a grave charge, and in that august
presence the Pontiff, whom no witnesses dared to accuse,
cleared himself of the crimes imputed to him by solemnly
taking the oath of denial in company with twelve priests as
compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Three years afterwards, the Emperor decreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
that, in all doubtful cases, priests should defend themselves
with three, five, or seven ecclesiastical compurgators, and he
announced that this decision had been reached by the common
consent of pope, patriarchs, bishops, and all the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> It
is true that a few months later, on being shown a decretal of
Gregory II.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> ordering the clergy to rebut with their single
oaths all accusations unsupported by witnesses, he modified
his previous command, and left the matter to the discretion of
his prelates; but this had no practical result, for Charlemagne’s
capitulary was adopted in the canon law and ascribed
to Leo himself.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The custom soon received the papal sanction
again in the most solemn manner. In 823, Pope Pascal
I. was more than suspected of complicity in the murder of
Theodore and Leo, two high dignitaries of the papal court.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Desirous to avoid an investigation by the commissioners sent
by Louis le Débonnaire, he hastily purged himself of the
crime in anticipation of their arrival, by an oath taken with a
number of bishops as his compurgators;<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and it is a striking
example of the weight accorded to the procedure that,
although the assumed fault of the victims had been their
devotion to the imperial party, and though the pope had by
force of arms prevented any pursuit of the murderers, the
emperor was powerless to exact satisfaction, and there was
nothing further to be done. Pope Pascal stood before the
world an innocent man.</p>

<p>It is true that, in the tenth century, Atto of Vercelli complains
bitterly that a perverse generation refused to be satisfied
with the single oath of an accused priest, and required him
to be surrounded by compurgators of his class, which that
indignant sacerdotalist regarded as a grievous wrong.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> As the
priesthood, however, failed in obtaining the entire immunity
for which they strove during those turbulent times, the unquestioned
advantages which compurgation afforded recommended
it to them with constantly increasing force. Forbidden
at length to employ the duel in settling their differences, and
endeavoring, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, to obtain
exemption from the ordeal, they finally accepted compurgation
as the special mode of trial adapted to members of the church,
and for a long period we find it recognized as such in all the
collections of canons and writings of ecclesiastical jurists.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
From this fact it obtained its appellation of <i>purgatio canonica</i>,
or canonical compurgation.</p>

<small>SELECTION OF COMPURGATORS.</small></h3>


<p>As already remarked, the origin of the custom is to be
traced to the principle of the unity of families. As the
offender could summon his kindred around him to resist an
armed attack of the injured party, so he took them with him
to the court, to defend him with their oaths. Accordingly,
we find that the service was usually performed by the kindred,
and in some codes this is even prescribed by law, though not
universally.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> This is well illustrated in the Welsh laws, where
the <i>raith</i>, or compurgation, was the basis of almost all procedure,
and where consequently the system was brought to its
fullest perfection. Complicated rules existed as to the proportion
of paternal and maternal kindred required in various
cases, and the connection between the <i>wer-gild</i> and the
obligation of swearing in defence of a kinsman was fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
recognized—“Because the law adjudges the men nearest in
worth in every case, excepting where there shall be men under
vows to deny murder,” therefore the compurgators were required
to be those “nearest to obtain his worth if killed.”<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
Under these circumstances, the <i>raith-man</i> could be objected to
on the score of not being of kin, when the oaths of himself
and his principal were received as sufficient proof of relationship;<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
and the <i>alltud</i>, or foreigner, was not entitled to the
raith unless he had kindred to serve on it.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> How the custom
sometimes worked in practice among the untameable barbarians
is fairly illustrated by a case recounted by Aimoin as occurring
under Chilperic I. in the latter half of the sixth century. A
wife suspected by her husband offered the oath of purgation
on the altar of St. Denis with her relatives, who were persuaded
of her innocence; the husband not yet satisfied, accused the
compurgators of perjury, and the fierce passions of both parties
becoming excited, weapons were speedily drawn, and the
sanctity of the venerable church was profaned with blood.<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>It was manifestly impossible, however, to enforce the rule
of kinship in all cases, for the number of compurgators varied
in the different codes, and in all of them a great number were
required when the matter at stake was large, or the crime or
criminal important. Thus when Chilperic I. was assassinated
in 584, doubts were entertained as to the legitimacy of his son
Clotair, an infant of four months—doubts which neither the
character of Queen Fredegonda nor the manner of Chilperic’s
death had any tendency to lessen—and Gontran, brother of
the murdered king, did not hesitate to express his belief that
the royal child’s paternity was traceable to some one of the
minions of the court, a belief doubtless stimulated by the
promise it afforded him of another crown. Fredegonda, however,
repaired her somewhat questionable reputation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
secured the throne to her offspring, by appearing at the altar
with three bishops and three hundred nobles, who all swore
with her as to the legitimacy of the little prince, and no further
doubts were ventured on the delicate subject.<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> A similar case
occurred in Germany in 899, when Queen Uta cleared herself
of an accusation of infidelity, by taking a purgatorial oath
with eighty-two nobles.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> So in 824, a dispute between Hubert,
Bishop of Worcester, and the Abbey of Berkeley, concerning
the monastery of Westbury, was settled by the oath of the
bishop, supported by those of fifty mass-priests, ten deacons,
and a hundred and fifty other ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> These were,
perhaps, exceptional instances, but in Wales the law required,
as a regular matter, enormous numbers of compurgators in
many cases. Privity to homicide, for instance, was divided
into three triads, or nine classes of various degrees of guilt.
Of these, the first triad called for one hundred raith-men to
establish the denial; the second triad, 200, and the third,
300;<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> while, to rebut an accusation of killing with savage
violence or poisoning, the enormous number of six hundred
compurgators was considered necessary.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Even these armies
of oath-takers did not widen the circle from which selection
was allowed, for the law absolutely specifies that “the oaths
of three hundred men of a kindred are required to deny
murder, blood, and wound,”<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and the possibility of finding
them is only explicable by the system of tribes or clans in
which all were legally related one to another. This is illustrated
by a further regulation, according to which, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Gwentian code, in an accusation of theft, with positive evidence,
the thief was directed to clear himself with twenty-four
raith=men of his own <i>cantrev</i> or district, in equal number from
each <i>cymwd</i> or sub-district.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Under a different social organization, it is evidently impossible
that a kindred sufficiently large could have been
assembled in the most numerous families, and even when the
requirements were more reasonable, the same difficulty must
frequently have occurred. This is recognized in the Danish
laws of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, where the conjuratorial
oaths of kindred, known as <i>neffn i kyn</i>, were requisite,
unless the accused could swear that he had no relations, in
which case he was allowed to produce twelve other men of
proper character, <i>lag feste men</i>.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> In a constitution of Frederic
II. in 1235, the compurgators are required to be of the same
class as their principal, and to be <i>sinodales homines</i>, men of
undoubted character.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Thus the aid of those not connected
by ties of blood must often have been necessary, and as it was
a service not without danger, as we shall see hereafter, it is
not easy to understand how the requisite number was reached.
In certain cases, no doubt, the possibility of obtaining those
not bound by kindred to undertake the office is traceable to
the liability which in some instances rested upon a township
for crime committed within its borders;<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> while the system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
guilds in which the members shared with each other a responsibility
resembling that of kinship rendered participation in the
oath of denial almost a necessity when a comrade was
prosecuted.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>It would be endless to specify all the variations in the
numbers required by the different codes in all imaginable cases
of quarrel between every class of society. Numerous elements
entered into these regulations; the nature of the crime or
claim, the station of the parties, the rank of the compurgators,
and the mode by which they were selected. Thus, in the
simplest and most ancient form, the Salic law merely specifies
twenty-five compurgators to be equally chosen by both parties.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
Some formulas of Marculfus specify three freeholders and
twelve friends of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> A Merovingian edict of 593
directs the employment of three peers of the defendant, with
three others chosen for the purpose, probably by the court.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Alternative numbers, however, soon make their appearance,
depending upon the manner in which the men were chosen.
Thus among the Alamanni, on a trial for murder, the accused
was obliged to secure the support of twenty designated men,
or, if he brought such as he had selected himself, the number
was increased to eighty.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> So, in a capitulary of 803, Charlemagne
prescribes seven chosen conjurators, or twelve if taken
at random,<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> a rule which is virtually the same as that laid
down by the Emperor Henry III. in the middle of the eleventh
century.<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> In 922 the council of Coblentz directs that accusations
of sacrilege could be rebutted with twenty-four chosen
men, or seventy-two freemen not thus selected.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> In Bigorre
the law thus discriminated against the <i>cagots</i>—an infamous
wandering race of uncertain origin—for cases in which the
oaths of seven conjurators ordinarily sufficed required thirty
<i>cagots</i>, when the latter were called upon to act.<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> In an English
record of the fifteenth century we find a defendant called upon
to prove his innocence with six of his neighbors or twelve
strangers.<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Strangely enough, the church at one time adopted the
principle that the higher the rank of the accused the more he
must present of his peers as compurgators. Thus the bishop
required eleven bishops, the priest five priests, and the deacon
two deacons; but Cardinal Henry of Susa who enunciates
this says it is an error, and that the number is at the discretion
of the judge.<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The rule, moreover, that the compurgators
must be of the same rank and class as the accused was waived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
when they were presumably inimical to him or the proper
number could not be had, and thus a cleric might be cleared
by the oaths of laymen.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Variations likewise occur arising from the nature of the case
and the character of the plaintiff. Thus in the Scottish law
of the twelfth century, in a criminal charge, a man could defend
himself against his lord with eleven men of good reputation,
but if the king were the accuser, twenty-four were
requisite, who were all to be his peers, while in a civil case
twelve were sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> So in the burgher laws of David I.,
ordinary cases between citizens were settled with ten conjurators,
but eleven were necessary if the king were a party,
or if the matter involved the life, limb, or lands of one of
the contestants; and in cases occurring between a citizen and
a countryman, each party had to provide conjurators of his
own class.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> In the complicated rules for compurgation which
form the basis of the Welsh jurisprudence, there are innumerable
details of this nature. We have seen that for some
crimes many hundred <i>raith-men</i> were required, while similar
numbers were enjoined in some civil suits respecting real
property.<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> From this the number diminishes in proportion to
the gravity of the case, as is well illustrated by the provisions
for denying the infliction of a bruise. If the mark remained
until the ninth day, the accused could deny it with “two
persons of the same privilege as himself;” if it remained
until the eighteenth day, the oaths of three conjurators were
necessary; if till the twenty-seventh day, four <i>raith-men</i> were
required.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>The character of the <i>raith-men</i> also affected the number
demanded. Thus, in a collection of Welsh laws of the fifteenth
century there is an explanation of the apparent anomaly
that privity to theft or homicide required for its defence a
vastly greater number of compurgators than the commission
of the crime itself. The large bodies prescribed for the former
consisted simply of any men that could be had—of course
within the recognized grades of kindred—while, for the latter,
rules of varying complexity were laid down. Thus, of the
twenty-four required for theft, in some texts it is prescribed
that two-thirds are to be of the nearest paternal kin, and one-third
of the nearest maternal; or, again, one-half <i>nod-men</i>.<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
So, in accusations of homicide, the same proportions of
paternal and maternal kindred were required, all were to be
proprietors in the country of the <i>raith</i>, and three, moreover,
were to be men under vows of abstinence from linen, horses,
and women, besides a proper proportion of <i>nod-men</i>.<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>Instances also occur in which the character of the defendant
regulated the number required. Among the Welsh, the
laws of Hoel Dda provide that a wife accused of infidelity
could disprove a first charge with seven women; if her conduct
provoked a second investigation, she had to procure
fourteen; while, on a third trial, fifty female conjurators were
requisite for her escape.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Another application of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
principle is found in the provision that when a man confessed
a portion of the crime imputed to him and denied the remainder,
an augmented <i>raith</i> was required to support his
denial, because it is more difficult to believe a man who has
admitted his participation in a criminal act. Thus when only
fifty men were requisite to rebut a charge of homicide, and
the accused admitted one of the accessories to homicide, his
denial of the main charge had to be substantiated by one
hundred, two hundred, or three hundred men, according to
the nature of the case. On the other hand, where no criminal
act was concerned, confession of a portion diminished the
<i>raith</i> for the remainder. Thus in a claim for suretyship, six
compurgators were necessary to the defendant; but if he admitted
part of the suretyship, his unsupported oath was sufficient
to rebut the remainder, as the admission of a portion
rendered him worthy of belief.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> In the Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence,
the <i>frangens jusjurandum</i>, as it was called, also
grew to be an exceedingly complex system in the rules by
which the number and quality of the conjurators were regulated
according to the nature of the crime and the rank of
the accused. In cases of peculiar atrocity, such as violation
of the sanctity of the grave, only thanes were esteemed competent
to appear.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In fact, among the Anglo-Saxons, the
value of a man’s oath was rated according to his rank, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of a thane, for instance, being equal to those of seven villeins.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
The same peculiarity is observable among the Frisians,
whose laws required that compurgators should be of the same
class as their principal, and the lower his position in the State,
the larger was the number requisite.<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>It was, however, not only the number of compurgators required
that affected the result, but the method by which they
were chosen, and this gave rise to wide variations in practice.
Originally, it is probable that the selection was left to the
accused, who gathered them from among his kindred. This
would lead almost inevitably to his acquittal, as forcibly
pointed out by Hincmar in the ninth century. In objecting
to admit the purgation of an offending priest with ecclesiastics
of his own choice, he states that evil-minded men combined
together to defeat justice and secure immunity for their crimes
by serving each other in turn, so that when the accused insisted
on offering his companions to the oath, it was necessary to
make them undergo the ordeal to prove their sincerity.<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> His
expressions indicate that the question of selection at that time
was undecided in France, and the alternative numbers alluded
to above show one of the methods adopted to meet the evident
evils of the process. Other nations devised various expedients.
The original Lombard law of King Rotharis gave to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
plaintiff the privilege of naming a majority of the compurgators,
the remainder being chosen by the defendant,<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> but
even in this the solidarity of the family was recognized, since
it was the duty of the plaintiff to select the nearest relatives
of his adversary, provided they were not personally hostile
to the accused.<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> This same spirit is shown even so late as
1116, in a charter by which Baldwin VII. of Flanders gratified
the citizens of Ypres by substituting among them the
process of compurgation for the ordeal and battle trial. According
to this, the accuser selected four of the relatives of
the accused to take the purgatorial oath; if they refused
through known enmity, he was bound to select four other of
the kindred, and if none such were to be found then four
legal men sufficed.<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The English law was the first to educe
a rational mode of trial from the absurdity of the barbaric
traditions, and there the process finally assumed a form
which occasionally bears a striking resemblance to trial by
jury—in fact, it insensibly runs into the latter, to the rise of
which it probably contributed. By the laws of Canute, in
some cases, fourteen men were named to the defendant, among
whom he was obliged to find eleven willing to take the purgatorial
oath with him.<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> The selection of these virtual jurors
was probably made by the <i>gerefa</i>, or sheriff;<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> they could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
challenged for suspicion of partiality or other competent cause,
and were liable to rejection unless unexceptionable in every
particular.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Very similar to this was the <i>stockneffn</i> of the
ancient Danish law, by which, in cases where the relatives
were not called upon, thirteen men were chosen, a majority of
whom could clear the accused by taking the oath with him.
They were nominated by a person appointed for the purpose,
and if the court neglected this duty, the privilege enured to
the plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> More facile for the defence was a process prescribed
in a Spanish charter of 1135, where, in cases of homicide,
it sufficed for the accused to obtain five conjurators out
of twelve selected by the magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> A method combining
selection and chance is described in the custumal of Ipswich
in the twelfth century, to decide questions of debt between
the townsfolk. The party on whom proof was incumbent
brought in ten men; these were divided into two bands of
five each, and a knife was thrown up between them; the band
towards which the point of the knife fell was taken, one of the
five was set aside, and the remaining four served as conjurators.<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>The Northern nations were evidently less disposed to favor
the accused than the Southern. In Sweden and Denmark,
another regulation provides that although the defendant had
a right to demand this mode of purgation, yet the plaintiff
had the selection of the twelve men who served as conjurators;
three of these the accused could challenge for enmity, but
their places were supplied by the plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> The evanescent
code compiled for Iceland by Haco Haconsen and his son
Magnus, towards the close of the thirteenth century, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
more equitable in its provisions. Though it leaves the nomination
of the conjurators to the defendant, the choice is subject
to limitations which placed it virtually in the power of
the court. They were required to be men of the vicinage,
of good repute, peers of the accused, and in no way connected
with him by blood or other ties.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> The more lasting code
promulgated at the same time by Magnus for his Norwegian
dominions, a code which became the common law of Norway
for 500 years, provides, for cases in which eleven conjurators
are required, that seven of them shall be selected of intelligent
men of full age, and in no way related to the accused, yet
residents of the vicinage, and acquainted with the facts; the
accused can then add four more of good character, himself
making the twelfth.<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> We see here, as in the English jurisprudence,
how nearly the conjuratorial process approaches to
the jury-trial, and how completely it has departed from its
origin in the solidarity of the family.</p>

<p>Such care in the selection of those on whom duties so responsible
devolved did not prevail among the more Southern
races at an earlier age. Among the Lombards slaves and
women in tutelage were often employed.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> The Burgundians
required that the wife and children, or, in their absence, the
father and mother of the accused should assist in making up
the number of twelve,<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> the object being evidently to increase
the responsibility of the family for the action of its head.
The abuses of this custom, however, caused its prohibition
under Charlemagne for the reason that it led to the swearing
of children of tender and irresponsible age.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> That legislator,
however, contented himself with forbidding those who had
once been convicted of perjury from again appearing either as
witnesses or conjurators;<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> and the little care that was deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
necessary in their selection under the Carlovingian jurisprudence
is shown by a law of Louis le Débonnaire ordering
that landless freemen should be allowed to serve as conjurators,
though ineligible as witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> A truer conception of the
course of justice is manifested, some centuries later, by the
Béarnese legislation, which required that the <i>seguidors</i> or
conjurators, as well as the <i>testimonis</i> or witnesses should be
men able to pay the amount at stake, together with the fine
incurred by the losing party,<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> or that they should be fair and
loyal men, not swayed by enmity.<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>In ecclesiastical trials it would seem that the selection of
compurgators rested with the bishop. In a case occurring in
the thirteenth century, of a priest accused of homicide who
failed in his compurgation, he appealed to the Holy See on the
ground that his accusers were perjurers and that the bishop
had chosen the compurgators to suit himself.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> As a matter of
course, the result of the trial depended, as it does with the
modern jury, on the fairness with which the choice was made,
and in the universal corruption of the middle ages there is no
reason to suppose that favoritism or bribery was not a controlling
influence in a majority of cases.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<small>CONDITIONS OF COMPURGATION.</small></h3>


<p>The conditions under which resort was had to this mode of
deciding litigation have been the subject of some discussion.
It has been assumed that, in the early period, before the
ferocious purity of the Barbarians had become adulterated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
under the influence of Roman civilization, it was used in all
description of cases, at the option of the defendant, and was
in itself a full and satisfactory proof, received on all hands as
equal to any other.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The only indication that I have met
with, among the races of Teutonic stock, tending to the support
of such a conjecture, occurs in the Lombard code, where
Rotharis, the earliest compiler of written laws, abolishes a
previously existing privilege of denying under oath a crime
after it had been confessed.<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> A much more powerful argument
on the other side, however, is derivable from the earliest
text of the Salic law, to which reference has already been
made. In this, the formula shows clearly that conjurators
were only employed in default of other testimony;<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> and what
lends additional force to the conclusion is that this direction
disappears in subsequent revisions of the law, wherein the influences
of Christianity and of Roman civilization are fully
apparent. No safe deductions, indeed, can be drawn from
mere omissions to specify that the absence of witnesses was
necessary, for these ancient codes are drawn up in the rudest
manner, and regulations which might safely be presumed to
be familiar to every one would not, in their curt and barbarous
sentences, be repeated with the careful redundancy which
marks our modern statutes. Thus there is a passage in the
code of the Alamanni which declares in the most absolute
form that if a man commits a murder and desires to deny it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
he can clear himself with twelve conjurators.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> This, by itself,
would authorize the assumption that compurgation was allowed
to override the clearest and most convincing testimony, yet it
is merely a careless form of expression, for another section of
the same code expressly provides that where a fact is proved
by competent witnesses the defendant shall not have the
privilege of producing compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>It therefore seems evident that, even in the earliest times,
this mode of proof was only an expedient resorted to in
doubtful matters, and on the necessity of its use the <i>rachinborgs</i>
or judges probably decided. A case recorded in the
Landnamabok certainly shows that among the heathen Norsemen
the Godi or priest-judge had this power, for when
Thorbiorn Digre prosecuted Thorarin of Mafahlid for horse-stealing,
and demanded that he should produce twelve conjurators,
Arnkell, the Godi, decided that the accused might
clear himself with his simple oath on the holy ring of the
altar, and thus the prosecution came to naught except as
leading to a bloody feud.<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> That this discretion was lodged
in the court in subsequent times is generally admitted. It is
scarcely worth while to multiply proof; but a few references
will show the light in which the custom was regarded.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>As employed by the Church, the rule was distinctly enunciated
in the thirteenth century that the accused was not to be
allowed to clear himself by canonical purgation when the
crime was notorious or when the accuser offered to prove the
charge.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The Welsh, however, were exceptional in this respect. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
<i>raith</i> was the corner-stone of their system of jurisprudence. It
was applied to almost all actions, whether of civil or criminal
law, and even cases of doubtful paternity were settled by it,
no woman, except one “of bush and brake” who had no legal
kindred, being allowed to give testimony or take an oath with
respect to the paternity of her illegitimate child.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> It excluded
and superseded all other procedures. If the accused declined
to take the oath of denial, then testimony on both sides could be
introduced, and the case be settled on the evidence adduced;<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
but where he chose to abide by the <i>raith</i>, the Book of Cynog
formally declares that “Evidences are not to be brought as
to <i>galanas</i> [homicide], nor <i>saraad</i> [insults], nor blood, nor
wound, nor ferocious acts, nor waylaying, nor burning buildings,
nor theft, nor surety, nor open assault, nor adultery, nor
violence, nor in a case where guardians should be, nor in a
case where an established raith is appointed by law; because
evidences are not to extinguish a raith.”<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Indeed, the only
case which I have found wherein it was refused is where a
priest of the same parish as one accused of theft testifies to
have seen him in open daylight with the article stolen in his
possession, when apparently the sacred character of the witness
precludes a denial on the part of the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>Among other races confidence in its ability to supplement
absent or deficient testimony was manifested in another form—the
<i>juramentum supermortuum</i>—which was employed by various
nations, at wide intervals of time. Thus, in the earliest
legislation of the Anglo-Saxons, we find that when the defendant
or an important witness was dead, the oath which he
would have taken or the deposition which he would have made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
was obtained by proceeding to his tomb, where a certain number
of conjurators swore as to what he could or would have
done if alive.<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Two centuries later, the same custom is alluded
to in the Welsh laws of Hoel Dda,<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and even as late as the
thirteenth century it was still in force throughout Germany.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
There were other cases in which evidence of any kind was
almost impossible, and in these the wager of law offered a
convenient resource. Thus, Frederic II., in 1235, decreed
that a man harboring an outlaw should himself be outlawed,
but he was allowed to prove with six conjurators that he was
ignorant of the outlawry.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>A remarkable use of conjurators to confirm the evidence of
witnesses occurs in 850 in a dispute between Cantius, Bishop
of Siena, and Peter, Bishop of Arezzo, concerning certain
parishes claimed by both. The occasion was a solemn one,
for it was before a council held in Rome presided over jointly
by Pope Leo IV. and the Emperor Louis II. Peter relied
upon written charters, while Cantius produced witnesses. The
Emperor pronounced the claim of the latter to be just, when
he and twelve priests swore that the oaths of the witnesses were
true and without deceit, whereupon the disputed parishes were
adjudged to him.<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The employment of compurgators, however, depended frequently
upon the degree of crime alleged, or the amount at
stake. Thus, in many codes, trivial offences or small claims
were disposed of by the single oath of the defendant, while
more important cases required compurgators, whose numbers
increased with the magnitude of the matter in question. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
principle is fairly illustrated in a charter granted to the Venetians
in the year 1111 by Henry V. In suits which involved
only the value of a silver pound, the oath of the party was
sufficient; but if the claim amounted to twelve pounds or
more, then twelve chosen men were requisite to substantiate
the oath of negation.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>In England in the thirteenth century we find compurgation
very generally employed in the manorial courts for the settlement
of petty criminal actions. So general was its use, indeed,
that it obtained the name of “law,” as the legal method <i>par
excellence</i>, and the process is curtly described in the reports as
“facere legem,” “esse ad legem,” “vadiare legem,” whence
is derived the term “wager of law.” The number of compurgators
was generally two or five, and they seem to have
been left, as a rule, to the choice of the defendant, so that
failure to procure the requisite number was very unusual.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>In later times, compurgation was also sometimes used as an
alternative when circumstances prevented the employment of
other popular modes of deciding doubtful cases. Those, for
instance, who would ordinarily be required to defend themselves
by the wager of battle, were permitted by some codes
to substitute the oaths of a certain number of conjurators, when
precluded by advanced age from appearing in the arena. The
burgher law of Scotland affords an example of this,<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> though
elsewhere such cases were usually settled by the substitution of
champions. Class privileges also manifested themselves in
this as in so many other features of mediæval law, and we
sometimes find compurgation allowed as a favor to those of
gentle birth. Thus, in the Council of Reims in 1119, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the provisions for the enforcement of the Truce of God, accusations
of its violation are rebutted by knights with six compurgators,
while common people are required to undergo the
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<small>FORMULAS AND PROCEDURE.</small></h3>


<p>The primitive lawgivers were too chary of words in their
skeleton codes to embody in them the formula usually employed
for the compurgatorial oath. We have therefore no positive
evidence of its nature in the earliest times; but as the forms
made use of by several races at a somewhat later period have
been preserved, and as they resemble each other in all essential
respects, we may reasonably assume that little variation
had previously occurred. The most ancient that I have met
with occurs in an Anglo-Saxon formulary which is supposed
to date from about A. D. 900: “By the Lord, the oath is
clean and unperjured which N. has sworn.”<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> A century later,
in a compilation of the Lombard law, it appears: “That
which the accused has sworn is true, so help me God.”<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The
form specified in Béarn, at a period somewhat subsequent, is
curt and decisive: “By these saints, he tells the truth;”<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
while the code in force in Normandy until the sixteenth century
directs an oath identical in spirit: “The oath which
William has sworn is true, so help me God and his saints.”<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
It will be observed that all these, while essentially distinct
from the oath of a witness, are still unqualified assertions of
the truth of the principal, and not mere asseverations of belief
or protestations of confidence. The earliest departure from
this positive affirmation, in secular jurisprudence, occurs in
the unsuccessful attempt at legislation for Norway and Iceland
by Haco Haconsen in the thirteenth century. In this, the
impropriety of such oaths is pointed out, and it is directed
that in future the compurgator shall swear only, in confirmation
of his principal, that he knows nothing to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
In the similar code promulgated in 1274 by his son Magnus
in Norway, it is directed that the accused shall take a full oath
of denial, and the conjurators shall swear in the same words
that his oath is true, and that they know nothing truer.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>We shall see that, before the custom fell into total disuse,
the change which Haco vainly attempted, came to be generally
adopted, in consequence, principally, of the example set by
the church. Even before this was formally promulgated by
the Popes, however, ecclesiastics occasionally showed that they
were more careful as to what they swore, and at a comparatively
early period they introduced the form of merely asserting
their belief in the oath taken by their principal. Thus,
in 1101, we find two bishops endeavoring to relieve a brother
prelate from a charge of simony, and their compurgatorial
oath ventures no further than “So help me God, I believe
that Norgaud, Bishop of Autun, has sworn the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>In the form of oath, however, as well as in so many other
particulars, the Welsh had a more complicated system, peculiar
to themselves. The ordinary <i>raith-man</i> only was required
to take an oath “that it appears most likely to him that what
he swears to is true.” In many aggravated crimes, however,
a certain proportion, generally one-half, had to be <i>nod-men</i>
who were bound to a more stringent form, as the law specifies
that “the oath of a nod-man is, to be in accordance with
what is sworn by the criminal.”<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The difference, as we have
seen, in the numbers required when a portion were <i>nod-men</i>
shows how much more difficult it was to find men willing to
swear to an absolute denial, and how much more weight was
attached to such a declaration than to the lax expression of
opinion contained in the ordinary oath of the <i>raith-man</i>.</p>

<p>Variations are likewise observable in the form of administering
the oath. Among the Alamanni, for instance, the compurgators
laid their hands upon the altar, and the principal
placed his hand over the others, repeating the oath alone;<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
while among the Lombards, a law of the Emperor Lothair
directs that each shall take the oath separately.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> It was
always, however, administered in a consecrated place, before
delegates appointed by the judges trying the cause, sometimes
on the altar and sometimes on relics. In the Welsh laws of
the fifteenth century it is specified that all <i>raiths</i> shall be administered
in the parish church of the defendant, before the
priest shall have disrobed or distributed the sacramental
bread.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> At an earlier period a formula of Marculfus specifies
the Capella S. Martini, or cope of St. Martin,<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> one of the most
venerated relics of the royal chapel, whence we may perhaps
conclude that it was habitually used for that purpose in the
business of the royal Court of Appeals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the universality of the custom, and the absolute
character of the decisions reached by the process, it is
easy to discern that the confidence reposed in it was of a very
qualified character, even at an early period. The primitive
law of the Frisians describes some whimsical proceedings,
prescribed for the purpose of determining the responsibility
for a homicide committed in a crowd. The accuser was at
liberty to select seven from among the participants of the
brawl, and each of these was obliged to deny the crime with
twelve conjurators. This did not absolve them, however, for
each of them was also individually subjected to the ordeal,
which finally decided as to his guilt or innocence. In this,
the value of the compurgation was reduced to that of the
merest technical ceremony, and yet a failure to procure the
requisite number of supporters was tantamount to a conviction,
while, to crown the absurdity of the whole, if any one
succumbed in the ordeal, his conjurators were punished as
perjurers.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> A similar want of confidence in the principle involved
is shown by a reference in the Anglo-Saxon laws to the
conjurators of an accused party being outsworn (<i>overcythed</i>),
when recourse was likewise had to the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Among the
heathen Norsemen, indeed, an offer by either party to produce
conjurators could always be met by the antagonist with
a challenge to the duel, which at once superseded all other
proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> As regards the church, although the authoritative
use of compurgation among ecclesiastics would seem to
demand for it among them implicit faith in its results, yet we
have already seen that, in the ninth century, Hincmar did not
hesitate to require that in certain cases it should be confirmed
by the ordeal; and two centuries later, a remark of Ivo of
Chartres implies a strong degree of doubt as to its efficacy.
In relating that Sanctio, Bishop-elect of Orleans, when accused
of simony by a disappointed rival, took the oath of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
negation with seven compurgators, he adds that the accused
thus cleared himself as far as he could in the eyes of man.<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
That the advantages it offered to the accused were duly appreciated,
both by criminals and judges, is evident from the case
of Manasses, Archbishop of Reims. Charged with simony
and other offences, after numerous tergiversations he was
finally summoned for trial before the Council of Lyons, in
1080. As a last effort to escape the impending doom, he
secretly offered to Bishop Hugh, the Papal legate, the enormous
sum of two hundred ounces of gold and other presents
in hand, besides equally liberal prospective payments, if he
could obtain the privilege of compurgation with six suffragan
bishops. Gregory VII. was then waging too uncompromising
a war with the corroding abuse of simony for his lieutenant to
yield to any bribe, however dazzling; the proffer was spurned,
Manasses confessed his guilt by absence, and was accordingly
deposed.<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Incidents like this, however, did not destroy confidence
in the system, for, some sixty years later, we find Innocent
II. ordering the Bishop of Trent, when similarly accused
of simony, to clear himself with the oaths of two bishops and
three abbots or monks.<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>The comparative value attached to the oaths of conjurators
is illustrated by the provisions which are occasionally met
with, regulating the cases in which they were employed in
default of witnesses, or in opposition to them. Thus, in the
Baioarian law, the oath of one competent witness is considered
to outweigh those of six conjurators;<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> and among the Lombards,
an accusation of murder which could be met with three
witnesses required twelve conjurators as a substitute.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>It is therefore evident that conjurators were in no sense witnesses,
that they were not expected to give testimony, and
that they merely expressed their confidence in the veracity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
their principal. It may consequently at first sight appear somewhat
unreasonable that they should be held guilty of perjury
and subject to its penalties in case of unluckily sustaining the
wrong side of a cause. It is probably owing to this apparent
injustice that some writers have denied that they were involved
in the guilt of their principal, and among others the learned
Meyer has fallen into this error.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> The proof, however, is too
clear for dispute. We have already seen that the oath was an
unqualified assertion of the justice of the side espoused, without
reservation justifying the escape of the compurgators from
the charge of false swearing, and one or two incidental references
have been made to the punishments inflicted on them
when subsequently convicted of perjury. The code of the
Alamanni recognized the guilt involved in such cases when it
denied the privilege of compurgation to any one who had previously
been more than once convicted of crime, giving as a
reason the desire to save innocent persons from incurring the
sin of perjury.<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Similar evidence is derived from a regulation
promulgated by King Liutprand in the Lombard Law, by
which a man nominated as a conjurator, and declining to
serve, was obliged to swear that he dared not take the oath
for fear of his soul.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> A case in point occurs in the life of St.
Boniface, whose fellow-laborer Adalger in dying left his property
to the church. The graceless brothers of the deceased
disputed the bequest, and offered to make good their claim to
the estate by the requisite number of oaths. The holy man
ordered them to swear alone, in order not to be concerned in
the destruction of their conjurators, and on their unsupported
oaths gave up the property.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>The law had no hesitation in visiting such cases with the
penalties reserved for perjury. By the Salic code unlucky
compurgators were heavily fined.<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Among the Frisians, they
had to buy themselves off from punishment by the amount of
their <i>wer-gild</i>—the value set upon their heads.<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> A slight
relaxation of this severity is manifested in the Carlovingian
legislation, by which they were punished with the loss of a
hand—the customary penalty of perjury—unless they could
establish, by undergoing the ordeal, that they had taken the
oath in ignorance of the facts; but even in trifling causes a
defeated litigant could accuse his own conjurator of perjury,
when both parties were sent to the ordeal of the cross, and if
the conjurator broke down he lost a hand.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> So late as the
close of the twelfth century, we find Celestin III. ordering
the employment of conjurators in a class of cases about the
facts of which they could not possibly know anything, and
decreeing that if the event proved them to be in error they
were to be punished for perjury.<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> That such liability was
fully recognized at this period is shown by the argument of
Aliprandus of Milan, a celebrated contemporary legist, who,
in maintaining the position that an ordinary witness committing
perjury must always lose his hand, without the privilege
of redeeming it, adds that no witness can perjure himself
unintentionally; but that conjurators may do so either knowingly
or unknowingly, that they are therefore entitled to the
benefit of the doubt, and if not wittingly guilty, that they
should have the privilege of redeeming their hands.<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>All this seems in the highest degree irrational, yet in
criticising the hardships to which innocent conjurators were
thus exposed, it should be borne in mind that the whole system
had become a solecism. In its origin, it was simply summoning
the kinsmen together to bear the brunt of the court, as they
were bound to bear that of battle; and as they were liable
for a portion of the fine which was the penalty of all crimes—personal
punishments for freemen being unknown—they
could well afford to incur the risk of paying for perjury in
order to avoid the assessment to be levied upon them in case
of the conviction of their relative. In subsequent periods,
when the family responsibility became weakened or disused,
and the progress of civilization rendered the interests of
society more complex, the custom could only be retained by
making the office one not to be lightly undertaken. A man
who was endeavoring to defend himself from a probable
charge of murder, or who desired to confirm his possession of
an estate against a competitor with a fair show of title, was
expected to produce guarantees that would carry conviction
to the minds of impartial men. As long as the practice
existed, it was therefore necessary to invest it with every
solemnity, and to guard it with penalties that would obviate
some of its disadvantages.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find that it was not always a matter of
course for a man to clear himself in this manner. The ancient
codes have frequent provisions for the fine incurred by those
unable to procure the requisite number of compurgators,
showing that it was an occurrence constantly kept in mind by
legislators. Nor was it only landless and friendless men who
were exposed to such failures. In 794, a certain Bishop
Peter was condemned by the Synod of Frankfort to clear
himself, with two or three conjurators, of the suspicion of
being involved in a conspiracy against Charlemagne, and,
small as was the number, he was unable to procure them.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
So, in the year 1100, when the canons of Autun, at the
Council of Poitiers, accused their bishop, Norgaud, of simony
and other irregular practices, and he proposed to absolve
himself with the compurgatorial oaths of the Archbishop of
Tours and the Bishop of Rédon, the canons went privately
to those prelates and threatened that in such event they would
bring an accusation of perjury and prove it by the ordeal of
fire, whereupon the would-be conjurators wisely abandoned
their intention, and Norgaud was suspended.<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> I have already
referred (p. 51) to a case before the Papal Penitentiary about
1240, in which a priest accused of homicide was put upon
his purgation and failed, whereupon his bishop deprived him
of function and benefice, and he hastened to Rome with a
complaint that the bishop had not been impartial in the
selection of compurgators. The most rigid compliance with
the requisitions of the law was exacted. Thus the statutes of
Nieuport, in 1163, provide a heavy penalty, and in addition
pronounce condemnation, when a single one of the conjurators
declines the oath.<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> It goes without saying that failure in
compurgation was equivalent to conviction or confession.<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<small>DECLINE OF COMPURGATION.</small></h3>


<p>In a system of which the fundamental principle was so
vicious, the best efforts of legislation could prove but a slight
palliation, and from an early period we find efforts made for
its abrogation or limitation. In 983, a constitution of Otho
II. abolished it in cases of contested estates, and substituted
the wager of battle, on account of the enormous perjury
which it occasioned.<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> In England, a more sweeping denunciation,
declaring its abolition and replacing it with the
vulgar ordeal, is found in the confused and contradictory
compilation known as the laws of Henry I.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>We have already seen, from instances of later date, how
little influence these efforts had in eradicating a custom so
deeply rooted in the ancestral prejudices of all the European
races. The hold which it continued to enjoy on the popular
confidence is well illustrated by the oath which, according to
the Romancero, was exacted of Alfonso VI. of Castile, by
the Cid to clear him of suspicion of privity to the death of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>

<p>In England, although as we have seen (p. 57), the wager of
law was the customary resource of the manorial courts in disputed
questions, the shrewd and intelligent lawyers who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
building up and systematizing the practice of the royal courts
were disposed to limit it as much as possible in criminal cases.
Towards the close of the twelfth century, Glanville compiled
his excellent little treatise “De legibus Angliæ,” the first
satisfactory body of legal procedure which the history of
mediæval jurisprudence affords. Complete as this is in all
the forms of prosecution and defence, the allusions to conjurators
are so slight as to show that already they were employed
rather on collateral points than on main questions.
Thus a defendant who desired to deny the serving of a writ
could swear to its non-reception with twelve conjurators;<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> and
a party to a suit, who had made an unfortunate statement or
admission in court, could deny it by bringing forward two to
swear with him against the united recollections and records of
the whole court.<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> The custom, however, still maintained its
hold on popular confidence. In 1194, when Richard I.
undertook, after his liberation, to bring about a reconciliation
between his chancellor William, Bishop of Ely, and the Archbishop
of York, one of the conditions was that the chancellor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
should swear with a hundred priestly compurgators that he
had neither caused nor desired the arrest of the archbishop.<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
In the next century Bracton alludes to the employment of conjurators
in cases of disputed feudal service between a lord and
his vassal, wherein the utmost exactness was rigidly required
both as to the number and fitness of the conjurators,<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> and we
shall see that no formal abrogation of it took place until the
nineteenth century. An outgrowth of the custom, moreover,
was the Inquest of Fame, by which “the general character of
the accused, as found by a jury, was accepted as an indication
of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.”<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>Soon after the time of Glanville, the system of compurgation
received a severe shock from its most important patron,
the church. As stated above, in proceedings between ecclesiastics,
it was everywhere received as the appropriate mode
of deciding doubtful cases. At the same time the absolute
character of the compurgatorial oath was too strong an incentive
to perjury, ignorant or wilful, for conscientious minds
to reconcile themselves to the practice, and efforts commenced
to modify it. About 1130 Innocent II., in prescribing compurgation
for the Bishop of Trent, accused of simony, orders
that the oath of the conjurators shall be simply as to their
belief in the bishop’s oath.<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Gratian inserted this in his <i>Decretum</i>,
and a commentator soon afterwards speaks of it as an
opinion held by some authorities.<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> It was reserved for Innocent
III. to give this the full sanction of law as a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
regulation. Compurgation was too valuable a resource for
churchmen to be discarded, and he endeavored to check the
abuses to which it led, by demanding conjurators of good
character, whose intimacy with the accused would give weight
to their oaths.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> At the same time, in endeavoring to remove
one of the objections to its use, he in reality destroyed one of
its principal titles to respect, for in decreeing that compurgators
should only be obliged to swear to their belief in the
truth of the principal’s oath,<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> he attacked the very foundation
of the practice, and gave a powerful impulse to the tendency
of the times no longer to consider the compurgator as sharing
the guilt or innocence of the accused. Such an innovation
could only be regarded as withdrawing the guarantee which
had immemorially existed. To recognize it as a legal precept
was to deprive the proceeding of its solemnity and to render
it no longer a security worthy the confidence of the people or
sufficient to occupy the attention of a court of justice.</p>

<p>In the confusion arising from the long and varying contest
as to the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it
is not easy to determine the exact influence which this decretal
may have exercised directly in secular jurisprudence.
We have seen above that the ancient form of absolute oath
was still employed without change until long after this
period, but the moral effect of so decided a declaration from
the head of the Christian church could not but be great.
Another influence, not less potent, was also at work. The
revival of the study of the Roman jurisprudence, dating from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
about the middle of the twelfth century, soon began to exhibit
the results which were to work so profound a change in the
legal maxims and principles of half of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The criminal
procedure of the Barbarians had rested to a great degree on
the system of negative proofs. In the absence of positive evidence
of guilt, and sometimes in despite of it, the accused was
bound to clear himself by compurgation or by the ordeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
The cooler and less impassioned justice of the Roman law
saw clearly the futility of such attempts, and its system was
based on the indisputable maxim that it is morally impossible
to prove a negative—unless, indeed, that negative should
chance to be incompatible with some affirmative susceptible
of evidence—and thus the onus of proof was thrown upon the
accuser.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> The civil lawyers were not long in recognizing the
truth of this principle, and in proclaiming it far and wide.
The Spanish code of Alfonso the Wise, in the middle of the
thirteenth century, asserts it in almost the same words as the
Roman jurisconsult.<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> Not long before, the Assises de Jerusalem
had unequivocally declared that “nul ne peut faire preuve
de non;” and Beaumanoir, in the <i>Coutumes du Beauvoisis</i>,
approvingly quotes the assertion of the civil doctors to the
same effect, “Li clerc si dient et il dient voir, que negative
ne doit pas quevir en proeve.”</p>

<p>Abstract principles, however, though freely admitted, were
not yet powerful enough to eradicate traditional customs rooted
deeply in the feelings and prejudices of the age. The three
bodies of law just cited contradict their own admissions, in
retaining with more or less completeness the most monstrous
of negative proofs—the ordeal of battle—and the introduction
of torture soon after exposed the accused to the chances of the
negative system in its most atrocious form. Still these codes
show a marked progress as relates to the kindred procedure of
compurgation. The Partidas, promulgated about 1262, record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the convictions of an enlightened ruler as to what should be
law rather than the existing institutions of a people, and were
not accepted as authoritative until the middle of the fourteenth
century. The absence of compurgation in Spain,
moreover, was a direct legacy from the Wisigothic code,
transmitted in regular descent through the Fuero Juzgo.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
The Assises de Jerusalem is a more precious relic of mediæval
jurisprudence. Constructed as a code for the government
of the Latin kingdoms of the East, in 1099, by order of
Godfrey of Bouillon, it has reached us only in the form assumed
about the period under consideration, and as it presents
the combined experience of the warriors of many Western
races, its silence on the subject of conjurators is not a little
significant. The work of Beaumanoir, written in 1283, is not
only the most perfect embodiment of the French jurisprudence
of his time, but is peculiarly interesting as a landmark in
the struggle between the waning power of feudalism and the
Roman theories which gave intensity of purpose to the enlightened
centralization aimed at by St. Louis: and Beaumanoir
likewise passes in silence over the practice of compurgation,
as though it were no longer an existing institution. All these
legislators and lawyers had been preceded by the Emperor
Frederic II., who, in 1231, promulgated his “Constitutiones
Sicularum” for the government of his Neapolitan provinces.
Frederic was Latin, and not Teutonic, both by education and
predilection, and his system of jurisprudence is greatly in advance
of all that had preceded it. That conjurators should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
find no place in his scheme of legal procedure is, therefore,
only what might be expected. The collection of laws known
as the <i>Êtablissements</i> of St. Louis is by no means a complete
code, but it is sufficiently copious to render the absence of all
allusion to compurgation significant. In fact, the numerous
references to the Digest show how strong was the desire to
substitute the Roman for the customary law, and the efforts
of the king to do away with all negative proofs of course included
the one under consideration. The same may be said
of the <i>Livres de Jostice et de Plet</i> and the <i>Conseil</i> of Pierre de
Fontaines, two unofficial books of practice, which represent
with tolerable fulness the procedures in vogue during the latter
half of the thirteenth century; while the <i>Olim</i>, or records of
the Parlement of Paris, the king’s high court of justice, show
that the same principles were kept in view in the long struggle
by which that body succeeded in extending the royal jurisdiction
at the expense of the independence of the vainly resisting
feudatories. In the <i>Olim</i> from 1254 to 1318, I can find but
two instances in which compurgation was required—one in
1279 at Noyon, and one in 1284 at Compiègne. As innumerable
decisions are given of cases in which its employment
would have been equally appropriate, these two can only be
regarded as exceptional, and the inference is fair that some
local custom rendered it impossible to refuse the privilege on
these special occasions.<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>All these were the works of men deeply imbued with the
spirit of the resuscitated jurisconsults of Rome. Their labors
bear testimony rather to the influences tending to overthrow
the institutions bequeathed by the Barbarians to the Middle
Ages, than to a general acceptance of the innovations attempted.
Their authority was still circumscribed by the
innumerable jurisdictions which yet defied their gradual encroachments
and resolutely maintained ancestral customs.
Thus, in 1250, we find in the settlement of a quarrel between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Hugues Tirel Seigneur of Poix in Picardy and the commune
of that place, that one of the articles was to the effect that the
mayor with thirty-nine of the bourgeois should kneel before
the dame de Poix and offer to swear that an insult inflicted on
her had not been done, or that if it had, it had been in honor
of the Seigneur de Poix.<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Even an occasional instance may
be found where the central power itself permitted the use of
compurgation, showing how difficult it was to eradicate the
prejudices transmitted through ages from father to son, and
that the policy adopted by St. Louis and Philippe le Bel, aided
by the shrewd and energetic civil lawyers who assisted them
so ably, was not in all cases adhered to. Thus, in 1283, when
the bailli of Amiens was accused before the Parlement of
Paris of having invaded the privileges of the church by trying
three clerks accused of crime, it was decided that he should
swear with six compurgators as to his ignorance that the
criminals were ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> So, in 1303, a powerful noble
of the court of Philippe le Bel was accused of a foul and
treacherous murder, which a brother of the victim offered to
prove by the wager of battle. Philippe was endeavoring to
abolish the judicial duel, and the accused desired strongly to
escape that ordeal. He was accordingly condemned to clear
himself of the imputed crime by a purgatorial oath with
ninety-nine nobles, and at the same time to satisfy the fraternal
claim of vengeance with an enormous fine<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>—a decision
which offers the best practical commentary on the degree of
faith reposed in this system of purgation. Even the Parlement
of Paris in 1353 and a rescript of Charles le Sage in 1357
allude to compurgation as still in use and of binding force.<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>It was in the provinces, however, that the system manifested
its greatest vitality, protected both by the stubborn dislike to
innovation and by the spirit of independence which so long
and so bitterly resisted the centralizing efforts of the crown.
The Roman law concentrated all power in the person of the
sovereign, and reduced his subjects to one common level of
implicit obedience. The genius of the barbaric institutions
and of feudalism localized power. The principles were essentially
oppugnant, and the contest between them was prolonged
and confused, for neither party could in all cases recognize
the ultimate result of the minuter points involved, though each
was fully alive to the broad issues of the struggle.</p>

<p>How obstinate was the attachment to bygone forms may be
understood when we see even the comparatively precocious
civilization of a city like Lille preserve the compurgatorial
oath as a regular procedure until the middle of the fourteenth
century, even though the progress of enlightenment had long
rendered it a mere formality, without serious meaning. Until
the year 1351, the defendant in a civil suit was obliged to substantiate
the oath of denial with two conjurators of the same
sex, who swore to its truth, to the best of their belief.<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> The
minutest regulations were enforced as to this ceremony, the
position of every finger being determined by law, and though
it was the veriest formality, serving merely as an introduction
to the taking of testimony and the legal examination of the
case, yet the slightest error committed by either party lost him
the suit irrecoverably.<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Normandy was even more faithful to the letter of the ancient
traditions. The Coutumier in use until the revision of 1583
under Henry III. retains a remnant of the practice under the
name of <i>desrene</i>, by which, in questions of little moment, a
man could rebut an accusation with two or four compurgators,
even when it was sustained by witnesses. The form of procedure
was identical with that of old, and the oath, as we have
already seen (page 58), was an unqualified assertion of the
truth of that of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> Practically, however, we may
assume that the custom had become obsolete, for the letters
patent of Henry III., ordering the revision in 1577, expressly
state that the provisions of the existing laws “estoient la pluspart
hors d’usage et peu ou point entendu des habitants du
pays;” and that compurgation was one of the forgotten formulas
may fairly be inferred from the fact that Pasquier, writing
previous to 1584, speaks of it as altogether a matter of the
past.<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The fierce mountaineers of Béarn were comparatively inaccessible
to the innovating spirit of the age, and preserved
their feudal independence amid the progress and reform of the
sixteenth century long after it had become obsolete elsewhere
throughout Southern Europe. Accordingly, we find the practice
of compurgation maintained as a regular form of procedure
in the latest revision of their code, made by Henry II.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of Navarre in 1551, which continued in force until the eighteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The influence of the age is shown, however,
even there, in a modification of the oath, which is no longer
an unreserved confirmation of the principal, but a mere affirmation
of belief.<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>In Castile, a revival of the custom is to be found in the
code compiled by Pedro the Cruel, in 1356, by which, in
certain cases, the defendant was allowed to prove his innocence
with the oath of eleven hidalgos.<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> This, however, is so
much in opposition to the principles of the Partidas, which
had but a few years previous been accepted as the law of the
land, and is so contrary to the spirit of the Ordenamiento de
Alcalà, which continued in force until the fifteenth century,
that it can only be regarded as a tentative resuscitation of
mere temporary validity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Northern races resisted more obdurately the advances
of the reviving influence of the Roman law. Though we have
seen Frederic II. omitting all notice of compurgation in the
code prepared for his Neapolitan dominions in 1231, he did
not attempt to abrogate it among his German subjects, for it is
alluded to in a charter granted to the city of Regensburg in
1230.<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The Schwabenspiegel, which during the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries was the municipal law of Southern
Germany, directs the employment of conjurators in various
classes of actions which do not admit of direct testimony.<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
The code in force in Northern Germany, as we have already
seen, gave great facilities for rebutting accusations by the
single oath of the defendant, and therefore the use of conjurators
is but rarely referred to in the Sachsenspiegel, though
it was not unknown, for either of the parties to a judicial
duel could refuse the combat by procuring six conjurators to
swear with him that he was related to his antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> In the
Saxon burgher law, however, the practice is frequently alluded
to, and it would seem from various passages that a man of
good character who could get six others to take with him the
oath of denial was not easily convicted. But where there
was satisfactory proof, compurgation was not allowed, and in
homicide cases, if a relative of the slain decided to proceed
by the duel, his claim of vengeance was supreme, and no other
process was admissible.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> It is evident, however, that compurgation
retained its hold on popular respect when we see,
about 1300, the Emperor Albert I. substituting it for the duel
in a considerable class of criminal cases.<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> In the early part
of the sixteenth century, Maximilian I. did much to diminish
the use of the compurgatorial procedure,<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> but that he failed
to eradicate it entirely is evident from a constitution issued by
Charles V. in 1548, wherein its employment is enjoined in
doubtful cases in a manner to show that it was an existing
resource of the law, and that it retained its hold upon public
confidence, although the conjurators were only required to
swear as to their belief in the oath of their principal.<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>In the Netherlands it likewise maintained its position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Damhouder, writing in 1554, after describing its employment
in the Courts Christian, adds that by their example it
was occasionally used also in secular tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, as late as the middle of the fourteenth century,
its existence is proved by a statute which provides that if a
thief escaped from confinement, the lord of the prison should
clear himself of complicity with the evasion by the oaths of
thirty conjurators, of whom three were required to be nobles.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>The Scandinavian nations adhered to the custom with even
greater tenacity. In the code of Haco Haconsen, issued
towards the close of the thirteenth century, it appears as the
basis of defensive procedure in almost all criminal cases, and
even in civil suits its employment is not infrequently directed,
the number of conjurators being proportioned to the nature
of the crime or to the amount at stake, and regulations for
administering the oath being given with much minuteness.<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
In Denmark it was not abolished until near the middle of the
seventeenth century, under Christiern IV., after it had become
a crying abuse through the habit of members of families, and
even of whole guilds, entering into formal engagements to
support each other in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> The exact date of its
abrogation is a matter of uncertainty, and the stubbornness
with which the people clung to it is shown by the fact that
even in 1683 Christiern V., in promulgating a new code,
found it necessary formally to prohibit accused persons from
being forced to provide conjurators.<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> In Sweden, its existence
was similarly prolonged. Directions for its use are contained
in the code which was in force until the seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
century;<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> it is constantly alluded to in the laws of Gustavus
Adolphus;<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> and an edict of Charles XI. in 1662 reproves the
readiness with which men were everywhere prompt to serve as
compurgators, and requires the judges, before admitting them,
to investigate whether they are proper persons and what are
their reasons to believe in the innocence of their principal.<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
By this time, therefore, though not yet witnesses, they were
becoming assimilated to them.</p>

<p>The vitality of communal societies among the Slavs naturally
led to the maintenance of a custom which drew its
origin from the solidarity of families, and it is therefore not
surprising to find it in Poland described as in full force as
late as the eighteenth century, the defendant being obliged to
support his purgatorial oath with conjurators, who swore as to
its truth.<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Yet among the Poles confidence in it as a legal
proof had long been undermined. In 1368 Casimir III.
decreed that a man of good repute, when accused of theft,
could clear himself by his own oath; but if his character was
doubtful, and compurgation was prescribed, then if he fell
short by one conjurator of the number required, he should
satisfy the accuser, though he should not be rendered infamous
for the future. This led to an increase of crime, and a
hundred years later Casimir IV. proclaimed a law by which
compurgation was only allowed three times, after which a
persistent offender was abandoned to the full severity of the
law, as being presumably guilty and not deserving of escape.
At the same time any one summoned to compurgation, and
appearing before the judge without compurgators, was <i>ipso
facto</i> pronounced infamous. From a case recorded it would
appear that twelve conjurators were required to outweigh the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
single oath of the accuser.<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Among the southern Slavs the
custom was likewise preserved to a comparatively late date.
An edict of Hermann, Ban of Slavonia, in 1416, orders that
any noble accused of neglect to enforce a decree of proscription
against a malefactor, should purge himself with five of
his peers as conjurators, in default of which he was subject to
a fine of twenty marcs.<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>The constitutional reverence of the Englishman for established
forms and customs, however, nominally preserved this
relic of barbarism in the common law to a period later by
far than its disappearance from the codes of other nations.
The system of inquests and ordeals established by the Assize
of Clarendon in 1166 and the rise of the jury system led to
its being superseded in criminal matters, but in civil suits it
held its own. According to Bracton, in the thirteenth century,
in all actions arising from contracts, sales, donations,
etc., when there was no absolute proof, the plaintiff came into
court with his <i>secta</i>, and the defendant was bound to produce
two conjurators for each one advanced by the plaintiff, the evidence
apparently preponderating according to quantity rather
than quality.<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> From the context, it would appear that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
<i>secta</i> of the plaintiff consisted of his friends and followers
willing to take the oath with him, but not absolutely witnesses.
The Fleta, however, some twenty-five years later, uses the
term in the sense of witnesses, and in actions of debt directs
the defence to be made with conjurators double in number the
plaintiff’s witnesses,<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> thus offering an immense premium on
dishonesty and perjury. Notwithstanding this, the nobles and
gentry who came to London to attend the court and Parliament
apparently were subjected to many annoyances by the
citizens who strove to collect their debts, and in 1363 Edward
III. relieved them by abrogating the wholesome rule laid down
by Bracton, and enacting that a debtor could wage his law
with a sufficient number of conjurators in spite of any papers
put forward in evidence by the creditor, who is curtly told to
find his remedy in some other way.<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> The unquestionable advantages
which this offered to not the least influential part of
a feudal community probably had something to do with its
preservation. The “Termes de la Ley,” compiled in the
early part of the sixteenth century, states as the existing practice
that “when one shall wage his law, he shall bring with
him 6, 8, or 12 of his neighbors, as the court shall assign him,
to swear with him;” and when in a statute of 1585 imposing
severe fines for using wood or charcoal in iron manufacture it
is provided that offenders shall not be entitled to defence by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the wager of law, it shows that proceeding to be still in common
use, though it was recognized as a means of eluding
justice.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Style’s “Practical Register,” published in 1657,
also describes the process, but an absurd mistake as to the
meaning of the traditional expression “jurare manu” shows
that the matter was rather a legal curiosity than a procedure
in ordinary use; and, indeed, the author expressly states that
the practice having been “abused by the iniquity of the people,
the law was forced to find out another way to do justice to the
nation.” Still the law remained unaltered, and a case is recorded
occurring in 1708, known as Gunner’s case, where
“the plaintiff became nonsuit, when the defendant was ready
to perfect his law,”<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> and Jacob, in his “Review of the
Statutes,” published not long after, treats of it as still part of
the existing judicial processes. As the wager of law came to
be limited to simple actions of debt, shrewd lawyers found
means of avoiding it by actions of “trespass upon the case,”
and other indirect forms which required the intervention of a
jury, but Burn in his Law Dictionary (Dublin, 1792) describes
the whole process with all its forms as still existing, and in
1799 a case occurred in which a defendant successfully eluded
the payment of a claim by producing compurgators who “each
held up his right hand, and then laid their hands upon the
book and swore that they believed what the defendant swore
was true.” The court endeavored to prevent this injustice,
but was forced to accept the law of the land. Even this
did not provoke a change. In 1824, in the case of King <i>v.</i>
Williams (2 Barnewell &amp; Cresswell, 528), some black-letter
lawyer revived the forgotten iniquity for the benefit of a client
in want of testimony, and demanded that the court should
prescribe the number of conjurators necessary for the defence,
but the court refused assistance, desiring to give the plaintiff
the benefit of any mistake that might be made. Williams
then got together eleven conjurators, and appeared in court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
with them at his back, when the plaintiff, recognizing the
futility of any further proceedings, abandoned his case in
disgust.<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Still, the fine reverential spirit postponed the inevitable
innovation, and it was not until 1833 that the wager of
law was formally abrogated by 3 and 4 William IV., c. 42, s. 13.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>English colonists carried the ancestral custom across the sea
and seem to have resorted to it as an infallible mode of settling
certain cases for which no positive evidence could be
had. Small as was the infant colony of Bermuda, its court
records for a little more than six months show four instances
of its use, all of which occur in deciding cases of “suspition
of incontinency” regularly presented by the grand jury or the
ecclesiastical authorities.<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>Doubtless if the early records of Virginia and Massachusetts
could be searched similar evidence of its use would be found
in them. Indeed it is quite possible that, strictly speaking,
the wager of law may still preserve a legal existence in this
country. In 1712 an act of the Colony of South Carolina,
enumerating the English laws to be held as in force there,
specifically includes those relating to this mode of defence,
and I am not aware that they have ever been formally abrogated.<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>
In 1811 Chancellor Kilty, of Maryland, speaks of
the wager of law as being totally disused in consequence of
the avoidance of the forms of suit which might admit of its
employment, but he evidently regards it as not then specifically
abolished.<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the common sense of mankind was gradually eliminating
the practice from among the recognized procedures of
secular tribunals, the immutable nature of ecclesiastical observances
prolonged its vitality in the bosom of the church.
We have seen above that Innocent III., about the commencement
of the thirteenth century, altered the form of oath from
an unqualified confirmation to a mere assertion of belief in the
innocence of the accused. That this at once became the
standard formula in ecclesiastical cases is probable when we
find it adopted for the oaths of the compurgators who, during
the Albigensian persecution, were required by the nascent
Inquisition in all cases to assist in the purgation of such suspected
heretics as were allowed to escape so easily.<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
this is no doubt the “congruous purgation” to which Innocent
III. and Gregory IX. alluded as that by which suspected
heretics should clear themselves.<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Zealous inquisitors, however,
paid little attention to such forms which allowed their
victims a chance of escape, for it is related of Conrad of
Marburg, who for a short time spread terror and desolation
throughout Germany, that when the accused confessed he
subjected them to torture and the frightful penance provided
by the church, but that when they denied their guilt he sent
them at once to the stake. The compurgatorial process, however,
vindicated itself in a notable manner when Conrad’s
cruelties at length aroused effective opposition. Count Sayn,
whom he had accused, was virtually acquitted at the Council of
Mainz, July, 1233, soon after which Conrad was assassinated:
the count, however, required formal vindication, and at the
Diet of Frankfort, in February, 1234, he cleared himself of
the charge of heresy in the most imposing manner with a train
of compurgators comprising eight bishops, twelve Cistercian
abbots, twelve Franciscan and three Dominican monks, and
a number of Benedictine abbots, clergy, and noble laymen.
After this, in April, the Council of Mainz declared him and
others of Conrad’s victims to be innocent and to be restored
to reputation and to their possessions.<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>The practice of compurgation thus introduced at the foundation
of the Inquisition was maintained to the last by that
terrible tribunal. “Our holy mother church,” says Simancas,
Bishop of Badajos, a writer of the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> “can in
no way endure the suspicion of heresy, but seeks by various
remedies to cure the suspect. Sometimes she forces them to
abjure or to purge themselves; sometimes she elicits the truth
by torture, and very often she coerces them with extraordinary
punishments.” Therefore, any one whose orthodoxy was
doubtful, if he was unwilling to clear himself, at the command
of the judge, was held to be convicted of heresy. By the
secular law he had a year’s grace before condemnation, but
under the ecclesiastical law he was instantly punishable.<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>Canonical purgation, according to the rules of the Inquisition,
was indicated when public report rendered a man suspected
and there was no tangible evidence against him. The
number of compurgators was left to the discretion of the judge,
who at the same time decided whether the deficiency of one,
two, or more would amount to a condemnation. They were to
be peers of the accused; and though he was allowed to select
them, yet the qualification that they were to be good men and
orthodox practically left their nomination to the officials—even
as the customary accusation by the promotor-fiscal was
held to be in itself the requisite amount of suspicion required
as a condition precedent for the trial. The greater the suspicion,
however, the larger was the number of compurgators to
be adduced.</p>

<p>When the accused had chosen his men, and they were
accepted by the judge, they were summoned, and each one
examined separately by the Inquisitors as to his acquaintance
with the defendant—a process by which, it may readily be
conceived, the terrors of the Holy Office might easily be so
used as to render them extremely unwilling to become his
sponsors. They were then assembled together; the accused
was brought in, the charge against him was read, and he took
an oath denying it. Each conjurator was then taken separately
and sworn as to his belief in the truth or falsity of the
oath of denegation, and according as they expressed their
conviction of the veracity of the accused the sentence was
usually rendered, absolving or condemning him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>No process of administering compurgation can well be conceived
more shrewdly adapted to reduce to a minimum the
chances of acquittal, or to leave the result subject to the
wishes of the officials. The testimony of the doctors of law,
both civil and canon, accordingly was that it was blind, deceitful,
and perilous.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> In fact, it is easy to conceive of the
difficulty of finding five, or nine, or eleven men willing to risk
their lives and families by standing up in support of any one
who had fallen into the grasp of the Holy Office. The terrible
apprehension which the Inquisition spread abroad among
all classes, and the dread which every man felt of being suspected
and seized as an accomplice of heresy, are unconsciously
intimated by Simancas when, arguing against this
mode of trial, he observes that “the morals of mankind are
so corrupt at the present day, and Christian charity has grown
so cold, that it is almost impossible to find any one willing to
join in clearing his neighbor, or who does not easily believe
the worst of him and construe all doubtful things against him.
When it is enough for the condemnation of the accused that
the compurgators shall declare that they are ignorant or doubtful
as to his innocence, who is there that will not express doubt
when they know that he would not have been condemned to
purge himself if he had not been violently suspected?” For
these reasons he says that those of Moorish or Jewish stock
should never be subjected to it, for it is almost impossible not
to think ill of them, and, therefore, to send them to purgation
is simply to send them to the stake.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>For all this, there was a lively discussion in the time of
Simancas, whether if the accused succeeded in thus clearing
himself, it was sufficient for acquittal. Many Inquisitors, indeed,
held to the older practice that the accused should first
be tortured, when if no confession could be forced from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
he was put on his purgation; if he passed safely through this,
he was then made to abjure the errors of which he had not
been convicted, and after all this he was punished at the discretion
of the judge.<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Such an accumulation of injustice
seems incredible, and yet Simancas feels himself obliged to
enter into an elaborate discussion to prove its impropriety.</p>

<p>In countries where the Inquisition had not infected society
and destroyed all feeling of sympathy between man and man
this process of purgation was not impossible. Thus, in 1527,
during one of the early persecutions of the reformers under
Henry VIII., while numbers were convicted, two women, Margaret
Cowbridge and Margery Bowgas, were allowed to clear
themselves by compurgators, though there were several positive
witnesses against them. It is also noteworthy that in
these cases a portion of the compurgators were women.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>In the regular ecclesiastical courts the practice was maintained.
When the Council of Constance, in its futile efforts
at reformation, prepared an elaborate code of discipline, it
proposed strenuous regulations to correct the all-pervading vice
of simony. To prevent the sale of benefices this project of law
decreed deprivation of all preferment as the punishment for
such offences, and as transactions of the kind were commonly
accomplished in secret, it ordained that common report should
be sufficient for conviction; yet it nullified the regulation by
permitting the accused to clear himself by canonical purgation.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
Towards the close of the fifteenth century, Angelo da
Chiavasco describes it as customary where there is no formal
accuser and yet public rumor requires action, although the
judge can also order it in cases of accusation: if the defendant
fails of his purgation in the latter case he is to be punished
as provided for his crime; if there is only rumor, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
penalty is discretional.<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> The judge determined the number
of conjurators, who were all to be of good reputation and
familiar with the life of the accused; if he were a monk, they
ought if possible to be of the same order; they simply swore
to their belief in his oath of denial.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> A century later Lancelotti
speaks of compurgation as the only mode of defence then
in use in doubtful cases, where the evidence was insufficient.<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
This applied not only to cases between churchmen, but also
to secular matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Grillandus,
writing about 1530, speaks of six conjurators of the
kindred as the customary formula in proceedings for nullity of
marriage, and mentions an instance personally known to him,
wherein this procedure was successfully adopted by a wife desirous
of a divorce from her husband who for three years had
been rendered impotent by witchcraft, in accordance with the
rules laid down in the canon law for such cases.<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> And among
certain orders of monks within the last century, questions arising
between themselves were settled by this mode of trial.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>In England, after the Anglican Church had received its
final shape under Cranmer, during the reign of Edward VI.,
the custom appears in a carefully compiled body of ecclesiastical
law, of which the formal adoption was only prevented
accidentally by the untimely death of the young king. By
this, a man accused of a charge resting on presumptions and
incompletely proved, was required to clear himself with four
compurgators of his own rank, who swore, as provided in the
decretals of Innocent III., to their belief in his innocence.<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<small>ACCUSATORIAL CONJURATORS.</small></h3>


<p>Though not strictly a portion of our subject, the question is
not without interest as to the power or obligation of the plaintiff
or accuser to fortify his case with conjurators. There is
little evidence of such a custom in primitive times, but one
or two allusions to it in the <i>Leges Barbarorum</i> show that it
was occasionally practised. Some of the earlier texts of the
Salic law contain a section providing that in certain cases the
complainant shall sustain his action with a number of conjurators
varying with the amount at stake; a larger number is required
of the defendant in reply; and it is presumable that
the judges weighed the probabilities on either side and rendered
a decision accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> As this is omitted in the later
revisions of the law, it probably was not widely practised, or
regarded as of much importance. Among the Baioarians, a
claimant of an estate produced six conjurators who took the
oath with him, and whose united efforts could be rebutted by
the defendant with a single competent witness.<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> These directions
are so precise that there can be no doubt that the custom
prevailed to a limited extent among certain tribes, and a clause
in the Decree of Childebert in 597, providing that the oaths
of five or seven impartial men of good character shall convict
a thief or malefactor, would seem evidently to refer to conjurators
and not to witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> In the treaty between Childebert
and Clotair in 593, an accuser in case of theft is obliged to
give twelve conjurators, half of them selected by himself, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
swear that a theft has really taken place.<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> That it was, indeed,
more generally employed than the scanty references to it in the
codes would indicate, may be inferred from one of the ecclesiastical
forgeries which Charlemagne was induced to adopt
and promulgate. According to this, no accusation against a
bishop could be successful unless supported by seventy-two
witnesses, all of whom were to be men of good repute; forty-four
were required to substantiate a charge against a priest,
thirty-seven in the case of a deacon, and seven when a member
of the inferior grades was implicated.<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Though styled
witnesses in the text, the number required is so large that they
evidently could have been only conjurators, with whom the
complainant supported his oath of accusation, and the fabrication
of such a law would seem to show that the practice of
employing such means of substantiating a charge was familiar
to the minds of men.</p>

<p>Among the heathen Northmen, as we have seen, every
pleader, whether plaintiff or defendant, was obliged to take a
preliminary oath on the sacred <i>stalla hringr</i>, or altar ring,
duly bathed in the blood of an ox sacrificed for the purpose.
This custom was preserved in England, where the Anglo-Saxon
laws required, except in trivial cases, a “fore-oath”
from the accuser (<i>forath, antejuramentum, præjuramentum</i>),
and William the Conqueror, in his compilation of the laws of
Edward the Confessor, shows that this was sometimes strengthened
by requiring the addition of conjurators, who were in no
sense witnesses, since their oath had reference, not to the facts
of the case, but solely to the purity of intention on the part
of the accuser.<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Indications of the same procedure are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
found in the collection known as the laws of Henry I.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Probably
to the development of this may be attributed the peculiar
device of the <i>secta</i> already referred to (p. 84), consisting of
those who supported the plaintiff by their oaths while in no
sense absolute witnesses. They were not even examined
unless the defendant demanded it. The bringing of the <i>secta</i>
or suit remained a matter of form long after the actual production
of the witnesses had become obsolete in the fourteenth
century, and it was not finally abolished until 1852.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>In an age of comparative simplicity, it is natural that men
should turn rather to the guarantees of individual character, or
to the forms of venerable superstition, than to the subtleties of
legal procedure. Even as the defendant was expected to produce
vouchers of his truthfulness, so might the plaintiff be
equally required to give evidence that his repute among his
neighbors was such as to justify the belief that he would not
bring a false charge or advance an unfounded claim. The
two customs appear to arise from the same process of reasoning
and to be identical in spirit, leading to a contest between the
two parties as to which could bring forward the largest and
most credible number of conjurators, and the position of the
accused being outsworn was a recognized circumstance in
jurisprudence. Thus, the Council of Tribur in 895 provides
that in such case he must either confess or undergo the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
In process of time accusatorial conjurators became commonly
used in many places. In Béarn the laws of the thirteenth
century provide that in cases of debt under forty sous, where
there was no testimony on either side, the claimant could substantiate
his case by bringing forward one conjurator, while the
defendant could rebut it with two.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> A similar rule obtained in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
England in all actions arising from contracts and sales;<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> and
in the laws of Soest in Westphalia, compiled at the end of the
eleventh or the commencement of the twelfth century, an accusation
of homicide could be proved by six conjurators swearing
with the prosecutor, while if this failed the accused could then
clear himself with eleven compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Throughout Germany,
in the thirteenth century, we find the principle of accusing
conjurators generally received, as is evident from the <i>juramentum
supermortuum</i> already referred to, and other provisions
of the municipal law.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> So thoroughly, indeed, was this
established that, in some places, in prosecutions for highway
robbery, arson, and other crimes, the accuser had a right to
require every individual in court, from the judge to the spectator,
to help him with an oath or to swear that he knew nothing
of the matter, and even the attorney for the defendant was
obliged to undergo the ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> In Sweden it was likewise
in use under the name of <i>jeff niteed</i>;<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> and in the compilation
of the laws by Andreas, Archbishop of Lunden, in the thirteenth
century, there is a curious provision for cases of secret
murder by which the accuser could force nine men successively
to undergo the hot-iron ordeal, after which, if thus far unsuccessful,
he could still force a tenth man to trial on producing
twelve conjurators to swear to the guilt of the accused—these
conjurators, in case of acquittal, being each liable to a fine of
three marks to the accused and as much to the church.<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> In
Norway and Iceland, in certain cases of imputed crime, the
accuser was bound to produce ten companions, of whom eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
appeared simply as supporters, while two swore that they had
heard the offence spoken of, but that they knew nothing about
it of their own knowledge—the amount of weight attached to
which asseveration is shown by the fact that the accused required
only two conjurators to clear himself.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most careful valuation of the oath of a plaintiff is
to be found in the Coutumier of Bordeaux, which provides that,
in civil cases not exceeding four sols in amount, the claimant
should substantiate his case by an oath on the Gospels in the
Mayor’s Court; when from four to twenty sols were at stake,
he was sworn on the altar of St. Projet or St. Antoine; from
twenty sols to fifteen livres, the oath was taken in the cemetery
of St. Seurin, while for amounts above that sum it was administered
on the “Fort” or altar of St. Seurin himself. Persons
whose want of veracity was notorious were obliged in all cases,
however unimportant, to swear on the Fort, and had moreover
to provide a conjurator who with an oath of equal solemnity
asserted his belief in the truth of his companion.<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p>The custom of supporting an accusatorial oath by conjurators
was maintained in some portions of Europe to a comparatively
recent period. Wachter<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> prints a curious account of a
trial, occurring in a Suabian court in 1505, which illustrates
this, as well as the weight which was still attached to the oath
of a defendant. A woman accused three men on suspicion of
being concerned in the murder of her husband. They denied
the charge, but when the oath of negation was tendered to
them, with the assurance that, if they were Suabians, it
would acquit them, they demanded time for consideration.
Then the advocate of the widow stepped forward to offer the
oath of accusation, and two conjurators being found willing
to support him the accused were condemned without further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
examination on either side. A similar process was observed
in the Vehmgericht, or Court of the Free Judges of Westphalia,
whose jurisdiction in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries became extended over the whole of Germany.
Accusations were supported by conjurators, and when the
defendant was a Frei-graff, or presiding officer of a tribunal,
the complainant was obliged to procure seven Frei-schöppen,
or free judges, to take the accusatorial oath with him.<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>The latest indication that I have met with of established
legal provisions of this nature occurs in the custom of
Britanny, as revised in 1539. By this, a man claiming compensation
for property taken away is to be believed on oath as
to his statement of its value, provided he can procure companions
worthy of credence to depose “qu’ils croyent que le
jureur ait fait bon et loyal serment.”<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Even this last vestige
disappears in the revision of the Coutumier made by order of
Henry III. in 1580.</p>

<small>THE WAGER OF BATTLE.</small></h2>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_I-2">CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p>When man is emerging from barbarism, the struggle between
the rising power of reason and the waning supremacy of
brute force is full of instruction. Wise in our generation, we
laugh at the inconsistencies of our forefathers, which, rightly
considered as portions of the great cycle of human progress,
are rather to be respected as trophies of the silent victory,
won by almost imperceptible gradations. When, therefore,
in the dark ages, we find the administration of justice so
strangely interrupted by appeals to the sword or to chance,
dignified under the forms of Christianized superstition, we
should remember that even this is an improvement on the all-pervading
first law of violence. We should not wonder that
barbarous tribes require to be enticed to the acknowledgment
of abstract right through pathways which, though devious,
may reach the goal at last. When the strong man is brought,
by whatever means, to yield to the weak, a great conquest is
gained over human nature; and if the aid of superstition is
invoked to decide the struggle, it is idle for us, while enjoying
the result, to contemn the means which the weakness of
human nature has rendered necessary to the end. With
uneducated nations, as with uneducated men, sentiment is
stronger than reason, and sacrifices will be made for the one
which are refused to the other. If, therefore, the fierce warrior,
resolute to maintain an injustice or a usurpation, can be
brought to submit his claim to the chances of an equal com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>bat
or of an ordeal, he has already taken a vast step towards
acknowledging the supremacy of right and abandoning the
personal independence which is incompatible with the relations
of human society. It is by such indirect means that
individuals, each relying on his own right hand, have been
gradually led to endure regular forms of government, and to
cherish the abstract idea of justice as indispensable between
man and man. Viewed in this light, the ancient forms of
procedure lose their ludicrous aspect, and we contemplate
their whimsical admixture of force, faith, and reason, as we
might the first rude engine of Watt, or the “Clermont,”
which painfully labored in the waters of the Hudson—clumsy
and rough it is true, yet venerable as the origin and prognostic
of future triumphs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a natural tendency in the human mind to cast the
burden of its doubts upon a higher power, and to relieve
itself from the effort of decision by seeking in the unknown
the solution of its difficulties. Between the fetish worshippers
of Congo and the polished sceptics who frequented the
<i>salon</i> of Mlle. le Normant, the distance, though great, is
bridged over by this common weakness; and whether the
information sought be of the past or of the future, the
impulse is the same. When, therefore, in the primitive
<i>mallum</i>, the wisdom of the <i>rachinborgs</i> was at fault, and the
absence or equal balance of testimony rendered a verdict
difficult, what was more natural than to appeal for a decision
to the powers above, and to leave the matter to the judgment
of God?<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Nor, with the warlike instincts of the race, is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
surprising that this appeal should be made to the God of
battles, to whom, whether they addressed him as Odin or
Sabaoth, they looked in every case for a special interposition
in favor of innocence. The curious mingling of procedure,
in these untutored seekings after justice, is well illustrated in
a form of process prescribed by the primitive Bavarian law.
A man comes into court with six conjurators to claim an
estate; the possessor defends his right with a single witness,
who must be a landholder of the vicinage. The claimant
then attacks the veracity of the witness—“Thou hast lied
against me. Grant me the single combat, and let God make
manifest whether thou hast sworn truth or falsehood;”<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> and,
according to the event of the duel is the decision as to the
truthfulness of the witness and the ownership of the property.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In discussing the judicial combat, it is important to keep in
view the wide distinction between the wager of battle as a judicial
institution, and the custom of duelling which has obtained
with more or less regularity among all races and at all ages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
When the Horatii met the Curiatii, or when Antony challenged
Octavius to decide the empire of the world with their two
swords, or when Edward III. in 1340 proposed to Philippe
de Valois to settle their rival claims to the heritage of France
army to army, a hundred to a hundred, or body to body,<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> or
when the ancient Hindus were in the habit of averting the
carnage of battles in the same manner<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>—these were simply expedients
to save the unnecessary effusion of blood, or to gratify
individual hate. When the <i>raffiné</i> of the times of Henri Quatre,
or the modern fire-eater, has wiped out some imaginary stain
in the blood of his antagonist, the duel thus fought, though
bearing a somewhat closer analogy to the judicial combat, is
not derived from it, but from the right of private vengeance
which was common to all the barbarian tribes, and from the
cognate right of private warfare which was the exclusive privilege
of the gentry during the feudal period.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> The established
euphuistic formula of demanding “the satisfaction of a gentleman,”
thus designates both the object of the custom and its
origin. The abolition of private wars gave a stimulus to the
duel at nearly the period when the judicial combat fell gradually
into desuetude. The one thus succeeded to the other,
and, being kindred in form, it is not surprising that for a time
there was some confusion in the minds of men respecting their
distinctive characteristics. Yet it is not difficult to draw the
line between them. The object of the one was vengeance and
reparation; the theory of the other was the discovery of truth
and the impartial ministration of justice.</p>

<p>It is easy to multiply examples illustrating this. John van
Arckel, a knight of Holland, followed Godfrey of Bouillon to
the first crusade. When some German forces joined the army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
a Tyrolese noble, seeing van Arckel’s arms displayed before
his tent, and recognizing them as identical with his own, ordered
them torn down. The insult was flagrant, but the injured
knight sought no immediate satisfaction for his honor.
He laid the case before the chiefs of the crusade as a judicial
matter; an examination was made, and both parties proved
their ancestral right to the same bearings. To decide the
conflicting and incompatible pretensions, the judges ordered
the judicial combat, in which van Arckel deprived his antagonist
of life and quarterings together, and vindicated his claim
to the argent 2 bars gules, which in gratitude to Heaven he
bore for eight long years in Palestine. This was not a quarrel
on a punctilio, nor a mode of obtaining redress for an insult,
but an examination into a legal question which admitted of no
other solution according to the manners of the age.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> When,
after the Sicilian Vespers, the wily Charles of Anjou was sorely
pressed by his victorious rival Pedro III. of Aragon, and desired
to gain time in order to repress a threatened insurrection
among his peninsular subjects, he sent a herald to Don Pedro
to accuse him of bad faith in having commenced the war without
defiance. The fiery Catalan fell into the snare, and in
order to clear himself of the charge, which was not ill-founded,
he offered to meet his accuser in combat and determine their
rights to the Sicilian throne. The terms were laboriously settled
by six representatives of each king and were signed by the
principals December 26, 1282; they were to meet, with a hundred
knights on each side, June 1, 1283, in the neutral territory
of Bordeaux and fight it out in the presence of Edward I.
of England or of his deputy, and each swore that if he failed
to be present he would forever hold himself as false and perjured
and deprived of the royal station and dignity. When
Charles applied to his cousin Edward to grant the <i>champ-clos</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
the latter emphatically replied that for the crowns of the Two
Sicilies he would not be judge in such a combat; Martin II.
chimed in with a bull forbidding him to serve, and the combat
never took place, Charles of Anjou having obtained his purpose
in the intervening suspension of arms.<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> Nothing more
picturesquely romantic is to be found in the annals of chivalry
than Muntaner’s relation of Don Pedro’s secret ride to Bordeaux
and his appearance on the day appointed in the lists
where Edward’s seneschal was unable to guarantee him a fair
field.<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> So the challenge which Richard II., in 1383, sent to
Charles VI. wore the aspect of the judicial duel to decide their
claims to the realms of France under the judgment of God.<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
Though practically these challenges may differ little from that
of Antony, still their form and purport were those of the judicial
duel in civil or criminal cases. So, when Charles V. offered
to maintain in single combat the charge that Francis I.
had villainously forfeited his faith in disregarding the treaty
of Madrid, and Francis hotly replied with a demand for a secure
field in which to defend his honor, the challenge and its
acceptance wore the form of the judicial duel to decide the
question of guilt; although Charles in appointing the Bidasoa
as the place of meeting gave as his reasons the avoidance of
bloodshed and the ending of the war as well as the maintenance
of his just cause.<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> The celebrated duel, fought in 1547,
between Jarnac and La Chastaigneraye, so piteously deplored
by honest old Brantôme, shows the distinction maintained to
the last. It was conducted with all judicial ceremonies, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
presence of Henry II., not to settle a point of honor, but to
justify Jarnac from a disgusting accusation brought by his adversary.
Resulting most unexpectedly in the death of La
Chastaigneraye, who was a favorite of the king, the monarch
was induced to put an end to all legalized combats, though
the illegal practice of the private duel not only continued to
flourish, but increased beyond all precedent during the succeeding
half century—Henry IV. having granted in twenty-two
years no less than seven thousand letters of pardon for
duels fought in contravention of the royal edicts. Such a
mode of obtaining “satisfaction” is so repugnant to the spirit
of our age that it is perhaps not to be wondered at if its advocates
should endeavor to affiliate it upon the ancient wager of
battle. Both relics of barbarism, it is true, are developments
from the same primitive habits and customs, yet they are essentially
distinct and have coexisted as separate institutions; and,
however much occasionally intermingled by the passions of
periods of violence, they were practised for different ends, and
were conducted with different forms of procedure. We have
only to deal with the combat as a strictly judicial process, and
shall, therefore, leave untouched the vast harvest of curious
anecdote afforded by the monomachial propensities of modern
times.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II-2" id="CHAPTER_II-2">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<small>ORIGIN OF THE JUDICIAL DUEL.</small></h3>


<p>The mediæval panegyrists of the wager of battle sought to
strengthen its title to respect by affirming that it was as old as
the human race, and that Cain and Abel, unable to settle their
conflicting claims in any other mode, agreed to leave the decision
to the chances of the duel; while the combat between
David and Goliath was considered by the early schoolmen as
an unanswerable proof of the favor with which God regarded
such encounters. Leaving such speculations aside, it is enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
for us to know that all the tribes which settled in Europe
practised the combat with so general a unanimity that its origin
must be sought at a period anterior to their separation from
the common stock, although it has left no definite traces in the
written records which have reached us of the Asiatic Aryans.<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p>That some vague notions of Divine justice making itself
manifest through the sword must have existed in prehistoric
Hellenic times is apparent from Homer’s elaborate description
of the duel between Menelaus and Paris. This has all
the characteristics of a judicial combat to decide the guilt or
innocence of the claimants for the possession of the fair Helen.
A preliminary sacrifice is offered to Zeus; Hector and Ulysses
measure out the ground; lots are cast to decide which of the
antagonists shall have the first throw of the spear; and the
assembled armies put up a prayer to Zeus, entreating him to
send to Hades the guilty one of the two combatants.<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> This
is not merely a device to put an end to the slaughter of brave
warriors—it is an appeal to Heaven to elicit justice by means
of arms.</p>

<p>The Italiote branch of the Aryans affords us a more definite
illustration of the same belief in the custom of the Umbrians,
who settled quarrels by single combat, and deemed that he
who slew his adversary thus proved that his cause was just.<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>Although Cæsar makes no mention of such a custom in
Gaul, it evidently prevailed among the Celtic tribes. Livy
describes how some Spaniards seized the opportunity of a show
of gladiators, given by Scipio, to settle various civil suits by
combat, and he proceeds to particularize a case in which two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
rival cousins decided in this manner a disputed question in
the law of descent, despite the earnest remonstrances of the
Roman commander.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Among the Irish Celts, at their appearance
in history, we find the judicial duel established with
fixed regulations. In the Senchus Mor, a code claiming to be
compiled under the supervision of St. Patrick, the delay of
five days in a distress is explained by the history of a combat
between two long previous in Magh-inis. “When they had
all things ready for plying their arms, except a witness alone,
they met a woman at the place of combat, and she requested
of them a delay, saying, ‘If it were my husband that were
there I would compel you to delay.’ ‘I would delay,’ said
one of them, ‘but it would be prejudicial to the man who sues
me; it is his cause that would be delayed.’ ‘I will delay,’
said the other. The combat was then put off, but they did
not know till when it was put off, until Conchubhur and
Sencha passed judgment respecting it; and Sencha asked,
‘What is the name of this woman?’ ‘Cuicthi,’ (five) said
she, ‘is my name.’ ‘Let the combat be delayed,’ said Sencha,
‘in the name of this woman for five days.’”<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The combative
ardor of the Feini, indeed, was so strong, and the appeal to
the wager of battle so general, that on their conversion to
Christianity they found it difficult to understand that the holy
ministers of Christ should be restricted from vindicating their
rights by arms, and St. Patrick, in a synod held in 456, was
obliged to threaten his clergy with expulsion from the church
if they endeavored to escape by appeal to the sword from
settling obligations which they had incurred by giving security
for heathens.<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>This prevalence of the wager of battle among the Irish Celts
renders probable its existence likewise among the early inhabitants
of Britain. If so, the long domination of the Romans
was doubtless sufficient to extinguish all traces of it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Welsh laws attributed to Hoel Dda in the early part of the
tenth century, which are exceedingly minute and precise in
their directions as to all forms of legal procedure, make no
allusion to it whatever. It is true that an ancient collection of
laws asserts that the code of Dyvnwal-moel-mud, a British
king, prescribed the ordeals of battle, of hot iron, and of
boiling water, and that Hoel in his legislation considered
them unjust, abrogated them, and substituted the proof by
men, or <i>raith</i>.<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> This legend, however, is very apocryphal.
There is no allusion to such customs in the Welsh codes up to
the close of the twelfth century, and the few indications which
occur in subsequent collections would seem to indicate that
these were rather innovations due to the influence of the English
conquest than revivals of ancient institutions.</p>

<p>Among the Slavs, as they emerge into history, the duel occupies
a controlling position in the administration of justice.
Ibn Dost, an Arab traveller in Russia in the tenth century,
relates that a pleader dissatisfied with the judgment of the king
could always appeal to the sword, and this decision was regarded
as so absolute that the defeated party, his family and
possessions were all at the disposition of the victor. In
Bohemia at a later period the successful combatant was required
to decapitate his antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> The earliest records of
the various other Slavic lands give evidence of the prevalence
of the judicial combat, showing that it formed part of their
ancestral customs prior to their occupation of their present
territories.<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>Among the Norræna branch of the Teutons the wager of
battle can be traced back to the realm of legend and tradition.
Saxo Grammaticus informs us that about the Christian era
Frotho III., or the Great, of Denmark, ordered the employment
of the duel to settle all controversies, preferring that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
his warriors should accustom themselves to rely, not on eloquence,
but on courage and skill;<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> and however doubtful the
chronology may be, the tradition shows that the origin of the
custom was lost in the depths of antiquity. Among the heathen
Norsemen, indeed, the <i>holm-gang</i>, or single combat, was so
universal an arbiter that it was recognized as conferring a
right where none pre-existed. Any athlete, who confided in
his strength and dexterity with his weapons, could acquire
property by simply challenging its owner to surrender his land
or fight for it. When Iceland, for instance, was in process of
settlement, Kraku Hreidar sailed thither, and on sighting land
invoked Thor to assign to him a tract of ground which he
would forthwith acquire by duel. He was shipwrecked on
reaching the shore, and was hospitably received by a compatriot
named Havard, with whom he passed the winter. In the
spring he declared his purpose of challenging Sæmund Sudureyska
for a sufficient holding, but Havard dissuaded him,
arguing that this mode of acquiring property rarely prospered
in the end, and Eirek of Goddolom succeeded in quieting him
by giving him land enough. Others of these hardy sea-rovers
were not so amenable to reason as Kraku. When Hallkell
came to Iceland and passed the winter with his brother Ketelbiorn,
the latter offered him land on which to settle, but Hallkell
disdained so peaceful a proposition, and preferred to summon
a neighbor named Grim to surrender his property or meet him
in the <i>holm-gang</i>. Grim accepted the defiance, was slain, and
Hallkell was duly installed as his heir. A variation of the
custom is illustrated by the case of Hrolleif, who after some
years’ settlement grew dissatisfied with his holding, and challenged
his neighbor Eyvind to an exchange of properties or a
combat, alternatives of which the peace-loving Eyvind accepted
the former.<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> The Saga of Egil Skallagrimsson speaks of a
noted duellist known as Ljot the Pale, who had come to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
district a landless stranger, and had grown wealthy by thus
challenging proprietors and taking their lands, but who met
his fate at the hands of Egil, who, while travelling, came to
the place where Ljot was about to engage in a holm-gang with
a weaker antagonist. Egil volunteered to take his place, and
promptly slew Ljot. The holm-gang was so named because
the battle was usually fought on a small island or holm; and
that it was regarded as an appeal to the gods is manifested by
the custom of the victor sacrificing an ox as soon as he left
the spot.<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>It is true that Tacitus makes no allusion to such a custom
among the Germans of his time, a passage which is frequently
quoted to that effect being in reality only a description of a
mode of divination in which, at the beginning of a war, one
of the enemy was captured and made to fight with a chosen
champion, the result of the combat being taken to foreshadow
the event of the contest.<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> The object of Tacitus,
however, was not to excite the curiosity of his countrymen,
but rather to contrast their vices with the uncivilized virtues
of the Germans, and his silence on this point is not a negative
evidence of weight in comparison with the positive proofs
which exist with regard to kindred tribes. Be this as it may,
as soon as we obtain an insight into their customs from written
laws, we find the wager of battle everywhere recognized.
The earliest of these is the code of the Burgundians, collected
by King Gundobald towards the close of the fifth century,
and in this the duel occupies a place so conspicuous that it
obtained in time the name of Lex Gundebalda or Loy Gombette,
giving rise to a belief that it was of Burgundian origin.</p>

<p>In the ordinary texts of the Salic law no mention is made
of it, but in one manuscript it is alluded to as a regular form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of procedure.<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> This silence, however, does not justify the
conclusion that the battle ordeal was not practised among the
Franks. Enough instances of it are to be found in their early
history to show that it was by no means uncommon;<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> and, at
a later period, the same absence of reference to it is observable
in the Lex Emendata of Charlemagne, though the capitularies
of that monarch frequently allude to it as a legal process
in general use. The off-shoots of the Salic law, the Ripuarian,
Allemannic, and Bavarian codes—which were compiled by
Thierry, the son of Clovis, revised successively by Childebert
and Clotair II., and put into final shape by Dagobert I. about
the year 630—in their frequent reference to the “campus,”
show how thoroughly it pervaded the entire system of Germanic
jurisprudence. The Lombards were, if possible, even
more addicted to its use. Their earliest laws, compiled by
King Rotharis in 643, seventy-six years after their occupation
of Italy, make constant allusion to it, and their readiness to
refer to its decision the most conspicuous cases is shown in
the story of Queen Gundeberga, the wife of Ariovaldus, who
was the immediate predecessor of Rotharis. Adalulf, a disappointed
lover, brought against her a charge of conspiracy
which induced Ariovaldus to cast her in prison, where she lay
for three years, until Clotair the Great, to whom she was of
kindred, sent an embassy to obtain her release. Diplomacy
was of no avail, and all that the Frankish envoys could accomplish
was to secure for her a trial by single combat, in
which a champion named Pitto overcame Adalulf the accuser,
and Gundeberga was restored to the throne with her innocence
recognized.<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Indeed, the tenacious hold which it maintained
on the veneration of the Lombards is seen in the
fruitless efforts to restrict its employment and to abrogate it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
by Rotharis and his successors under the civilizing influence
of contact with Roman institutions. Thus Rotharis forbids
its use in some cases of importance, substituting conjurators,
with a marked expression of disbelief, which shows how little
confidence was felt in its results by enlightened men.<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The
next lawgiver, King Grimoald, decreed that thirty years’ possession
of either land or liberty relieved a defendant from
maintaining his title by battle, the privilege of employing conjurators
being then conceded to him.<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> In the succeeding
century, King Liutprand sought to abolish it entirely, but
finding the prejudices of his people too strong to be overcome,
he placed on record in the statute-book a declaration of his
contempt for it and a statement of his efforts to do away with
it, while he was obliged to content himself with limiting the
extent of its application, and diminishing the penalties incurred
by the defeated party.<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>While the laws of the Angles, the Saxons, and the Frisians
bear ample testimony to the general use of the wager of battle,<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>
it is not a little singular that the duel appears to have
been unknown among the Anglo-Saxons. Employed so extensively
as legal evidence throughout their ancestral regions, by
the kindred tribes from which they sprang, and by the Danes
and Norwegians who became incorporated with them; harmonizing,
moreover, with their general habits and principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of action, it would seem impossible that they should not likewise
have practised it. I can offer no explanation of the
anomaly, and can only state the bare fact that the judicial
combat is not referred to in any of the Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Danish
codes.<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> There seems, indeed, to be no reason to
doubt that its introduction into English jurisprudence dates
only from the time of William the Conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>The Goths, while yet untainted by the influence of Rome,
were no less given to the employment of the judicial duel
than their Teutonic kindred, and Theodoric vainly endeavored
to suppress the custom among those of his subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
who had remained in Pannonia.<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> That no trace of it is to be
found among the extant laws of both Ostrogoths and Wisigoths,
framed subsequently to their settlement in Italy, France, and
Spain, is easily explained. The effect upon the invaders of the
decaying but still majestic civilization of Rome, the Byzantine
education of Theodoric, the leader of the Ostrogoths, and his
settled policy of conciliating the Italians by maintaining as far
as possible the existing state of society, preclude any surprise
that no allusion to the practice should occur in the short but
sensible code known as the “Edict of Theodoric,” which
shows how earnestly that enlightened conqueror endeavored to
fuse the invaders and the vanquished into one body politic.<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a>
With regard to the Wisigoths, we must remember that early
conversion to Christianity and long intercourse with civilization
had already worn off much of the primitive ferocity of a
race which could produce in the fourth century such a man as
Ulphilas. They were the earliest of the invaders who succeeded
in forming a permanent occupation of the conquered
territories; and settling, as they did, in Narbonensian Gaul and
Spain while the moral influence of Rome was yet all powerful,
the imperial institutions exercised a much greater effect upon
them than on the subsequent bands of Northern barbarians.
Accordingly, we find their codes based almost entirely upon the
Roman jurisprudence, with such modifications as were essential
to adapt it to a ruder state of society. Their nicely balanced
provisions and careful distinctions offer a striking contrast to
the shapeless legislation of the races that followed, and neither
the judicial combat nor canonical compurgation found a place
in them. Even the vulgar ordeal would appear to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
unknown until a period long subsequent to the conquest of
Aquitaine by Clovis, and but little anterior to the overthrow
of the Gothic kingdom of Spain by the Saracens. But even
as in Italy the Lombard domination destroyed the results of
Theodoric’s labors, so in France the introduction of the Frankish
element revived the barbarian instincts, and in the celebrated
combat before Louis le Débonnaire, between Counts
Bera and Sanila, who were both Goths, we find the “pugna
duorum” claimed as an ancient privilege of the race, with the
distinction of its being equestrian, in accordance with Gothic
usages, and so thoroughly was the guilt of Bera considered to
be proved by his defeat, that his name became adopted in the
Catalan dialect as a synonym of traitor.<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<small>UNIVERSAL USE OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.</small></h3>


<p>The wager of battle thus formed part of the ancestral institutions
of all the races who founded the nations of Europe.
With their conversion to Christianity the appeal was transferred
from the heathen deities to God, who was expected to intervene
and decide the battle in favor of the right.<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> It was an
appeal to the highest court and popular confidence in the arbitrament
of the sword was rather strengthened than diminished.
Enlightened lawgivers not only shared, to a greater or less
extent, in this confidence, but were also disposed to regard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
duel with favor as the most practical remedy for the crime of
false swearing which was everywhere prevalent. Thus Gundobald
assumes that its introduction into the Burgundian code
arose from this cause;<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Charlemagne urged its use as greatly
preferable to the shameless oaths which were taken with so
much facility;<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> while Otho II., in 983, ordered its employment
in various forms of procedure for the same reason.<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> It
can hardly be a source of surprise, in view of the warlike manners
of the times, and of the enormous evils for which a palliative
was sought, that there was felt to be advantage in this
mode of impressing upon principals and witnesses the awful
sanctity of the oath, thus entailing upon them the liability of
supporting their asseverations by undergoing the risks of a
combat rendered doubly solemn by imposing religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>Various causes were at work to extend the application of the
judicial duel to all classes of cases. In the primitive codes of
the barbarians, there is no distinction made between civil and
criminal law. Bodily punishment being almost unknown,
except for slaves, and nearly all infractions of the law being
visited with fines, there was no necessity for such niceties, the
matter at stake in all cases being simply money or money’s
worth. Accordingly, we find the wager of battle used indiscriminately,
both as a defence against accusations of crime,
and as a mode of settling cases of disputed property, real and
personal. Yet some of the earlier codes refer to it but seldom.
The Salic law, as we have seen, hardly recognizes its existence;
the Ripuarian code alludes to it but four times, and that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Alamanni but six times. In others, like the Baioarian, it is
appealed to on almost every occasion, and among the Burgundians
we may assume, from a remark of St. Agobard, that it
superseded all evidence and rendered superfluous any attempt
to bring forward witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> This variation is probably rather
apparent than real, and if in any of these bodies of laws there
were originally substantial limitations on its use, in time they
disappeared, for it was not difficult to find expedients to justify
the extension of a custom which accorded so perfectly with the
temper of the age. How little reason was requisite to satisfy
the belligerent aspirations of justice is shown by a curious provision
in the code of one of the Frisian tribes, by which a man
unable to disprove an accusation of homicide was allowed to
charge the crime on whomsoever he might select, and then the
question between them was decided by combat.<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>The elasticity, in fact, with which the duel lent itself to the
advantage of the turbulent and unscrupulous had no little
influence in extending its sphere of action. This feature in its
history is well exemplified in a document containing the proceedings
of an assembly of local magnates, held in the year
888, to decide a contention concerning the patronage of the
church of Lessingon. After the testimony on one side had
been given, the opposite party commenced in reply, when the
leaders of the assembly, seizing their swords, vowed that they
would affirm the truth of the first pleader’s evidence with their
blood before King Arnoul and his court—and the case was
decided without more ado.<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> The strong and the bold are apt
to be the ruling spirits in all ages, and were emphatically so in
those periods of scarcely curbed violence when the jurisprudence
of the European commonwealths was slowly developing
itself.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that means were readily found
for extending the jurisdiction of the wager of battle as widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
as possible. One of the most fruitful of these expedients was
the custom of challenging witnesses. The duel was a method
of determining questions of perjury, and there was nothing to
prevent a suitor, who saw his case going adversely, from accusing
an inconvenient witness of false swearing and demanding
the “campus” to prove it—a proceeding which adjourned
the main case, and likewise decided its result. This summary
process, of course, brought every action within the jurisdiction
of force, and deprived the judges of all authority to control the
abuse. That it obtained at a very early period is shown by a
form of procedure occurring in the Bavarian law, already referred
to, by which the claimant of an estate is directed to
fight, not the defendant, but his witness;<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and in 819 a capitulary
of Louis le Débonnaire gives a formal privilege to the accused
on a criminal charge to select one of the witnesses against
him with whom to decide the question in battle.<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> It is easy,
therefore, to understand the custom, prescribed in some of the
codes, by which witnesses were required to come into court
armed, and to have their weapons blessed on the altar before
giving their testimony. If defeated they were fined, and were
obliged to make good to the opposite party any damage which
their testimony, had it been successful, would have caused
him.<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>Nor was this merely a temporary extravagance. Late in
the thirteenth century, after enlightened legislators had been
strenuously and not unsuccessfully endeavoring to limit the
abuse of the judicial combat, the challenging of witnesses
was still the favorite mode of escaping legal condemnation.<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Even in the fourteenth century, the municipal law of Reims,
which allowed the duel between principals only in criminal
cases, permitted witnesses to be indiscriminately challenged
and forced to fight, affording them the privilege of employing
champions only on the ground of physical infirmity or advanced
age.<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> A still more bizarre extension of the practice,
and one which was most ingeniously adapted to defeat the
ends of justice, is found in a provision of the English law of
the thirteenth century, allowing a man to challenge his own
witnesses. Thus in many classes of crimes, such as theft,
forgery, coining, etc., the accused could summon a “warrantor”
from whom he professed to have received the articles
which formed the basis of the accusation. The warrantor
could scarcely give evidence in favor of the accused without
assuming the responsibility himself. If he refused, the accused
was at liberty to challenge him; if he gave the required evidence,
he was liable to a challenge from the accuser.<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> The
warrantor was sometimes also employed as a champion, and
served for hire, but this service was illegal and when detected
involved the penalties of perjury.<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> Another mode extensively
used in France about the same time was to accuse the principal
witness of some crime rendering him incapable of giving
testimony, when he was obliged to dispose of the charge by
fighting, either personally or by champion, in order to get his
evidence admitted.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>It is not easy to imagine any cases which might not thus be
brought to the decision of the duel; and the evidence of its
universality is found in the restriction which prevented the
appearance as witnesses of those who could not be compelled
to accept the combat. Thus the testimony of women and
ecclesiastics was not receivable in lay courts in suits where
appeal of battle might arise;<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> and when in the twelfth century
special privileges were granted by the kings of France
empowering serfs to bear testimony in court, the disability
which prevented a serf from fighting with a freeman was declared
annulled in such cases, as the evidence was only admissible
when the witness was capable of supporting it by arms.<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>The result of this system was that, in causes subject to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
appeals, no witness could be forced to testify, by the French
law of the thirteenth century, unless his principal entered into
bonds to see him harmless in case of challenge, to provide a
champion, and to make good all damages in case of defeat;<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>
though it is difficult to understand how this could be satisfactorily
arranged, since the penalties inflicted on a vanquished
witness were severe, being, in civil causes, the loss of a hand
and a fine at the pleasure of the suzerain, while in criminal
actions “il perderoit le cors avecques.”<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> The only limit to
this abuse was that witnesses were not liable to challenge in
cases concerning matters of less value than five sous and one
denier.<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the position of a witness was thus rendered unenviable,
that of the judge was little better. As though the duel had
not received sufficient extension by the facilities for its employment
just described, another mode of appealing to the sword
in all cases was invented by which it became competent for
the defeated party in any suit to challenge the court itself, and
thus obtain a forcible reversal of judgment. It must be borne
in mind that this was not quite as absurd a practice as it may
seem to us in modern times, for under the feudal system the
dispensing of justice was one of the most highly prized attributes
of sovereignty; and, except in England, where the royal
judges were frequently ecclesiastics, the seignorial courts were
presided over by warriors. In Germany, indeed, where the
magistrates of the lower tribunals were elective, they were required
to be active and vigorous of body.<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> Towards the end
of the twelfth century in England we find Glanville acknowledging
his uncertainty as to whether or not the court could
depute the settlement of such an appeal to a champion, and
also as to what, in case of defeat, was the legal position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the court thus convicted of injustice.<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> These doubts would
seem to indicate that the custom was still of recent introduction
in England, and not as yet practised to an extent
sufficient to afford a settled basis of precedents for its details.
Elsewhere, however, it was firmly established. In 1195, the
customs of St. Quentin allow to the disappointed pleader unlimited
recourse against his judge.<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> Towards the latter half
of the thirteenth century, we find in the <i>Conseil</i> of Pierre
de Fontaines the custom in its fullest vigor and just on the eve
of its decline. No restriction appears to be imposed as to the
cases in which appeal by battle was permitted, except that it
was not allowed to override the customary law.<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> The suitor
selected any one of three judges agreeing in the verdict; he
could appeal at any stage of the proceedings when a point was
decided against him; if unsuccessful, he was only liable in a
pecuniary penalty to the judges for the wrong done them, and
the judge, if vanquished, was exposed to no bodily punishment.<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>
The villein, however, was not entitled to the privi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>lege,
except by special charter.<a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> While the feudal system was
supreme, this appeal to arms was the only mode of reversing a
judgment, and an appeal in any other form was an innovation
introduced by the extension of the royal jurisdiction under St.
Louis, who labored so strenuously and so effectually to modify
the barbarism of feudal institutions by subordinating them to
the principles of the Roman jurisprudence. De Fontaines, indeed,
states that he himself conducted the first case ever known
in Vermandois of an appeal without battle.<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> At the same time
the progress of more rational ideas is manifested by his admission
that the combat was not necessary to reverse a judgment
manifestly repugnant to the law, and that, on the other hand,
the law was not to be set aside by the duel.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, we find in Beaumanoir abundant evidence
of the success of St. Louis in setting bounds to the
abuses which he was endeavoring to remove. The restrictions
which he enumerates are greatly more efficacious than those
alluded to by de Fontaines. In capital cases, the appeal did
not lie; while in civil actions, the suzerain before whom the
appeal was made could refuse it when the justice of the verdict
was self-evident. Some caution, moreover, was requisite in
conducting such cases, for the disappointed pleader who did not
manage matters rightly might find himself pledged to a combat,
single handed, with all his judges at once; and as the
bench consisted of a collection of the neighboring gentry, the
result might be the confirmation of the sentence in a manner
more emphatic than agreeable. An important change is likewise
observable in the severe penalty imposed upon a judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
vanquished in such an appeal, being a heavy fine and deprivation
of his functions in civil cases, while in criminal ones it
was death and confiscation—“il pert le cors et quanques il a.”<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>The king’s court, however, was an exception to the general
rule. No appeals could be taken from its judgments, for there
was no tribunal before which they could be carried.<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> The
judges of the royal court were therefore safe from the necessity
of vindicating their decisions in the field, and they even carried
this immunity with them and communicated it to those
with whom they might be acting. De Fontaines accordingly
advises the seigneur justicier who anticipates the appeal of battle
in his court to obtain a royal judge to sit with him, and
mentions an instance in which Philip (probably Philip Augustus)
sent his whole council to sit in the court of the Abbey of
Corbie, when an appeal was to be entered.<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>By the German law of the same period, the privilege of reversing
a sentence by the sword existed, but accompanied
with regulations which seem evidently designed to embarrass,
by enormous trouble and expense, the gratification of the impulse
which disappointed suitors would have to establish their
claims in such manner. Thus, by the Suabian law, it could
only be done in the presence of the sovereign himself, and not
in that of the immediate feudal superior;<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> while the Saxon code<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
requires the extraordinary expedient of a pitched battle, with
seven on each side, in the king’s presence.<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> It is not a little
singular that the feudal law of the same period has no allusion
to the custom, all appeals being regularly carried to and heard
in the court of the suzerain.<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<small>CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THE JUDICIAL DUEL.</small></h3>


<p>Thus carefully moulded in conformity with the popular prejudices
or convictions of every age and country, it may readily
be imagined how large a part the judicial combat played in the
affairs of daily life. It was so skilfully interwoven throughout
the whole system of jurisprudence that no one could feel
secure that he might not, at any moment, as plaintiff, defendant,
or witness, be called upon to protect his estate or his life
either by his own right hand or by the club of some professional
and possibly treacherous bravo. This organized violence
assumed for itself the sanction of a religion of love and
peace, and human intelligence seemed too much blunted to
recognize the contradiction.</p>

<p>There was, in fact, no question which might not be submitted
to the arbitrament of the sword or club. If Charlemagne,
in dividing his vast empire, forbade the employment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of the wager of battle in settling the territorial questions which
might arise between his heirs,<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> the prohibition merely shows
that it was habitually used in affairs of the highest moment,
and the constant reference to it in his laws proves that it was
in no way repugnant to his general sense of justice and propriety.</p>

<p>The next century affords ample evidence of the growing
favor in which the judicial combat was held. About the year
930, Hugh, King of Provence and Italy, becoming jealous of his
uterine brother, Lambert, Duke of Tuscany, asserted him to
be a supposititious child, and ordered him in future to claim
no relationship between them. Lambert, being “vir ...
bellicosus et ad quodlibet facinus audax,” contemptuously denied
the aspersion on his birth, and offered to clear all doubts
on the subject by the wager of battle. Hugh accordingly
selected a warrior named Teudinus as his champion; Lambert
was victor in the ensuing combat, and was universally received
as the undoubted son of his mother. His triumph, however,
was illegally brought to a sudden close, for Hugh soon after
succeeded in making him prisoner and deprived him of eyesight.<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
Still, the practice continued to be denounced by some
enlightened ecclesiastics, represented by Atto, Bishop of Vercelli,
who declared it to be totally inapplicable to churchmen
and not to be approved for laymen on account of the uncertainty
of its results;<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> but representations of this kind were
useless. About the middle of the century, Otho the Great
appears, throwing the enormous weight of his influence in its
favor. As a magnanimous and warlike prince, the wager of
battle appears to have possessed peculiar attraction for his
chivalrous instincts, and he extended its application as far as
lay in his power. Not only did he force his daughter Liutgarda,
in defending herself from a villanous accusation, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
forego the safer modes of purgation, and to submit herself to
the perilous decision of a combat,<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> but he also caused the
abstract question of representation in the succession of estates
to be settled in the same manner; and to this day in Germany
the division of a patrimony among children and grandchildren
is regulated in accordance with the law enacted by the doughty
arms of the champions who fought together nine hundred years
ago at Steil.<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> There was no question, indeed, which according
to Otho could not be satisfactorily settled in this manner.
Thus when, in 963, he was indulging in the bitter recriminations
with Pope John XII. which preceded the subjugation of
the papacy under the Saxon emperors, he had occasion to send
Bishop Liutprand to Rome to repel certain accusations brought
against him, and he ordered the armed followers of his ambassador
to sustain his assertions by the duel; a proposition
promptly declined by the pontiff, skilled though he was in the
use of weapons.<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> A duellist, in fact, seems to have been
reckoned a necessary adjunct to diplomacy, for when, in 968,
the same Liutprand was dispatched by Otho to Constantinople
on a matrimonial mission, and during the negotiations for the
hand of Theophania a discussion arose as to the circumstances
which had led to Otho’s conquest of Italy, the warlike prelate
offered to prove his veracity by the sword of one of his attendants:
a proposition which put a triumphant end to the argument.<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
A more formal assertion of the diplomatic value of
the duel was made when in 1177 the conflicting claims of the
kings of Castile and Navarre were referred to Henry II. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
England for adjudication, and both embassies to the English
court were supplied with champions as well as with lawyers,
so as to be prepared in case the matter was submitted to the
duel for decision.<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>Nor were these solitary instances of the reference of the
mightiest state questions to the chances of the single combat.
Allusion has already been made to the challenge which passed
between Charles of Anjou and Pedro of Aragon, and not dissimilar
was that which resulted from the interview at Ipsch in
1053 between the Emperor Henry III. of Germany and Henry
I. of France.<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> A hundred years earlier, in 948, when, at the
Synod of Ingelheim, Louis d’Outremer invoked the aid of the
Church in his death-struggle with the rising race of Capet, he
closed the recital of the wrongs endured at the hands of Hugh
le grand by offering to prove the justice of his complaints in
single combat with the aggressor.<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> When the battle ordeal
was thus thoroughly incorporated in the manners of the age,
we need scarcely be surprised that, in a life of St. Matilda,
written by command of her son Otho the Great, the author,
after describing the desperate struggles of the Saxons against
Charlemagne, should gravely inform us that the war was at
last concluded by a duel between the Christian hero and his
great antagonist Witikind, religion and empire being both
staked on the issue as a prize of the victor; nor does the
pious chronicler shudder at the thought that the destiny of
Christianity was intrusted to the sword of the Frank.<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> His
story could not seem improbable to those who witnessed in
1034 the efforts of Conrad the Salic to pacify the Saxon
marches. On his inquiring into the causes of the mutual
devastations of the neighboring races, the Saxons, who were
really the aggressors, offered to prove by the duel that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Pagan Luitzes were in fault, trusting that their Christianity
would overbalance the injustice of their cause. The defeat
of their champion by his heathen adversary was, however, a
memorable example of the impartial justice of God, and was
received as a strong confirmation of the value of the battle trial.<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>The second Otho was fully imbued with his father’s views,
and so completely did he carry them out, that in a gloss on
the Lombard law he is actually credited with the introduction
of the duel.<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> In the preceding essay, allusion has been made
to his substitution of the judicial combat for the compurgatorial
oath in 983, and about the same period he made an exception,
in favor of the battle ordeal, to the immemorial policy of
the barbarians which permitted to all subject races the enjoyment
of their ancestral usages. At the council of Verona,
where all the nobles of Italy, secular and ecclesiastical, were
assembled, he caused the adoption of a law which forced the
Italians in this respect to follow the customs of their conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
Even the church was deprived of any exemption which
she might previously have enjoyed, and was only allowed
the privilege of appearing by her <i>advocati</i> or champions.<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a>
There were small chances of escape from the stringency of
these regulations, for an edict of Otho I. in 971 had decreed
the punishment of confiscation against any one who should
refuse to undergo the chances of the combat.<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> It may even
be assumed, from the wording of a constitution of the Emperor
Henry II., that in the early part of the eleventh century
it was no longer necessary that there should be a doubt as
to the guilt of the accused to entitle him to the privileges of
the combat, and that even the most notorious criminal could
have a chance of escape by an appeal to the sword.<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that nearly every question that could
possibly arise was finally deemed liable to the decision of the
wager of battle. If Otho the Great employed champions to
legislate respecting a disputed point of law, he was not more
eccentric than the Spaniards, who settled in the same manner
a controversy regarding the canonical observances of religion,
when Gregory VII. endeavored to force the introduction of
the Roman liturgy into Castile and Leon, in lieu of the
national Gothic or Mozarabic rite. With considerable difficulty,
some years before, Navarre and Aragon had been led to
consent to the change, but the Castilians were doggedly
attached to the observances of their ancestors, and stoutly
refused compliance. In 1077, Alfonso I. procured the assent
of a national council, but the people rebelled, and after
repeated negotiations the matter was finally referred to the
umpirage of the sword. The champion of the Gothic ritual
was victorious, and tradition adds that a second trial was
made by the ordeal of fire; a missal of each kind was thrown
into the flames, and the national liturgy emerged triumphantly
unscathed.<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p>Nearly contemporary with this was the celebrated case of
Otho, Duke of Bavaria, perhaps the most noteworthy example
of a judicial appeal to the sword. A worthless adven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>turer,
named Egeno, accused Otho of conspiring against the
life of Henry IV. In a diet held at Mainz, the duke was
commanded to disprove the charge by doing battle with his
accuser within six weeks. According to some authorities, his
pride revolted at meeting an adversary so far his inferior; according
to others, he was prevented from appearing in the lists
only by the refusal of the emperor to grant him a safe conduct.
Be this as it may, the appointed term elapsed, his
default of appearance caused judgment to be taken against
him, and his duchy was accordingly confiscated. It was bestowed
on Welf, son of Azo d’Este and of Cunigunda, descendant
and heiress of the ancient Guelfic Agilolfings; and thus,
on the basis of a judicial duel, was founded the second Bavarian
house of Guelf, from which have sprung so many royal
and noble lines, including their Guelfic Majesties of Britain.
Some years later, the emperor himself offered to disprove by
the same means a similar accusation brought against him by a
certain Reginger, of endeavoring to assassinate his rival,
Rodolph of Suabia. Ulric of Cosheim, however, who was
involved in the accusation, insisted on taking his place, and
a day was appointed for the combat, which was prevented only
by the opportune death of Reginger.<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>Scarcely less impressive in its results, and even more remarkable
in itself, as exhibiting the duel invested with legislative
as well as judicial functions, is the case wherein the
wager of battle was employed in 1180 to break the overgrown
power of Henry the Lion. That puissant Duke of Saxony
and Bavaria had long divided the power of the empire and
defied the repeated efforts of Frederic Barbarossa to punish
his constantly recurring rebellions. Cited to appear and
answer for his treasons in successive diets, he constantly refused,
on the plea that the law required him to have a trial
within his own dominions. At length, in the diet of Würz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>burg,
a noble arose and declared himself ready to prove by
the single combat that the emperor could legally cite his
princes before him at any place that he might select within
the limits of the empire. Of course there was none to take
up the challenge, and Frederic was enabled to erect the principle
thus asserted into a binding law. Henry was condemned
by default, and his confiscated possessions were shared between
those who had arranged and enacted the comedy.<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>No rank of life in fact procured exemption from the duel
between antagonists of equal station. When in 1002, on the
death of Otho III., the German throne was filled by the election
of Henry the Lame, Duke of Bavaria, one of his disappointed
competitors, Hermann, Duke of Suabia, is said to
have demanded that their respective claims should be determined
by a judicial combat, and the new king, feeling himself
bound to accept the wager of battle, proceeded to the appointed
place, and waited in vain for the appearance of his
antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> Thus the champion of England, who until 1821
figured in the coronation pageant of Westminster Abbey, was
a relic of the times when it was not an idle ceremony for the
armed and mounted knight to fling the gauntlet and proclaim
aloud that he was ready to do battle with any one who challenged
the right of the new monarch to his crown.<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> A striking
example of the liability attaching to even the most exalted
rank is afforded by a declaration of the privileges of the
Duchy of Austria, granted by Frederic Barbarossa in 1156,
and confirmed by Frederic II. in 1245. These privileges
rendered the dukes virtually independent sovereigns, and
among them is enumerated the right of employing a champion
to represent the reigning duke when summoned to the judicial
duel.<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Even more instructive is the inference deducible from
the For de Morlaas, granted to his subjects by Gaston IV. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Béarn about the year 1100. The privileges contained in it
are guaranteed by a clause providing that, should they be infringed
by the prince, the injured subject shall substantiate
his complaint by his simple oath, and shall not be compelled
to prove the illegality of the sovereign’s acts by the judicial
combat, thus indicating a pre-existing custom of the duel between
the prince and his vassals.<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>It is not to be supposed, however, from these instances that
the duel was an aristocratic institution, reserved for nobles and
affairs of state. It was an integral part of the ordinary law,
both civil and criminal, employed habitually for the decision
of the most every-day affairs. Thus a chronicler happens to
mention that in 1017 the Emperor St. Henry II. coming to
Merseburg hanged a number of robbers who had been convicted
in single combat by champions, and then proceeding
to Magdeburg he had all the thieves assembled and treated
them in the same manner.<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> So much was it a matter of course,
that, by the English law of the thirteenth century, a pleader
was sometimes allowed to alter the record of his preliminary
plea, by producing a man who would offer to prove with his
body that the record was incorrect, the sole excuse for the
absurdity being that it was only allowed in matters which could
not injure the other side;<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> and a malefactor turning king’s
evidence was obliged, before receiving his pardon, to pledge
himself to convict all his accomplices, if required, by the duel.<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>The habitual use of such a method of administering justice
required no little robustness of faith in the expected intervention
of God to control the event. Even in the fifteenth century,
when the combat was rapidly becoming obsolete, this faith
is pictorially embodied in an illuminated MS. of Tallhöfer’s
Kamp-recht, where a miniature represents the victor kneeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
and returning thanks to God, while the vanquished is lying on
his back with Satan grasping at his open mouth as though
already seizing the soul of the criminal.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> This robustness of
faith was proof against experience and common sense, and
sought to explain the frequent miscarriage of justice by any
process of reasoning rather than the right one. Thus about
the year 1100 a sacrilegious thief named Anselm stole the
sacred vessels from the church of Laon and sold them to a
merchant, from whom he exacted an oath of secrecy. Frightened
at the excommunications fulminated by the authorities of
the plundered church, the unhappy trader revealed the name
of the robber. Anselm denied the accusation, offered the
wager of battle, defeated the unfortunate receiver of stolen
goods, and was proclaimed innocent. Encouraged by impunity,
he repeated the offence, and after his conviction by the
ordeal of cold water he confessed the previous crime. The
doubts cast by this event on the efficacy of the judicial combat
were, however, happily removed by the suggestion that the
merchant had suffered for the violation of the oath which he
had sworn to Anselm, and the reputation of the duel remained
intact.<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>The frequent cases of this nature often did not admit of so
ingenious an explanation of the criminal’s escape, and legal
casuists assumed a condition of being, guilty in the sight of
God, but not in that of man—a refinement of speculation which
even finds place in the German codes of the thirteenth century;<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and men contented themselves then, as they do still, with predicting
future misfortunes and an eternity of punishment. The
more direct solution, in cases of unjust condemnation, was very
much like that which justified the defeat of Anselm’s merchant—that
the unfortunate victim, though innocent of the special
offence charged, suffered in consequence of other sins. This
doctrine was even supported by the infallible authority of the
papacy, as enunciated in 1203 by Innocent III. in a case
wherein the priory of St. Sergius was unjustly convicted of
theft by the judicial duel, and its possessions were consequently
seized by the authorities of Spoleto.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>An example justifying this theory is found in the case of
Henry of Essex in 1163. He was a favorite of Henry II. and
one of the most powerful nobles of his day, till he was accused
of treason by his kinsman Robert de Montfort for having abandoned
his king when in desperate straits in the Welsh war of
1157. A duel ensued, fought on an island of the Thames
near Reading, in presence of an immense assemblage. Henry
had been a bad neighbor to the Abbey of St. Edmund, and
when engaged in the desperate contest he was dismayed at
seeing the angry saint hovering in the air and threatening
him; nor was this all, for Gilbert de Cerivilla, whom he had
unjustly put to death, likewise appeared and menaced him.
The inevitable result of this was his defeat; he was left for
dead on the field, but at the instance of his powerful kindred
his body was allowed Christian burial in the Abbey of Reading.
Carried thither he unexpectedly revived and embraced
a religious life in the abbey, where years afterwards he related
the story of his discomfiture to the veracious chronicler who
has handed it down.<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>That the combatants themselves did not always feel implicit
confidence in the event, or rely solely upon the righteousness
of their cause, is shown by the custom of occasionally bribing
Heaven either to assist the right or to defend the wrong.
Thus, in the eleventh century, we find the monastery of St.
Peter at Bèze in the enjoyment of certain lands bestowed on
the Saint by Sir Miles the Stammerer, who in this way endeavored
to purchase his assistance in a combat about to take
place—a bargain no doubt highly appreciated by the worthy
monks.<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> According to the belief of the pious, Heaven might
be propitiated by less venal means, for Cæsarius of Heisterbach
relates on the authority of an eye-witness that when
Henry VI. entered Lombardy in 1196, a castellan was accused
before him of oppression and rapine by his neighbors,
who produced a champion of enormous size to vindicate their
case. The Emperor decreed the battle, when the brother of
the accused offered himself for the defence—a slender and
most unequal antagonist. He prepared himself for the strife,
however, by assiduous confession and prayer, and easily overcame
his huge adversary; and thus, exclaims the worthy
chronicler, a guilty man escaped the death he had deserved,
solely by virtue of the humble confession of his brother.<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a>
Cæsarius also mentions another case, in a duel decreed by
Frederic Barbarossa between a knight and a gigantic champion,
where the inequality was more than counterbalanced by
the fact that the knight piously took the precaution of receiving
the sacrament before entering the lists, and thus was enabled
to overcome his adversary.<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Less creditable means were sometimes employed, and men
did not hesitate, with the unreasoning inconsistency characteristic
of superstition, to appeal to God and at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
endeavor to influence God’s judgment by the use of unlawful
expedients. This was not confined to the laity. In 1355
there was an important suit between the Bishop of Salisbury
and the Earl of Salisbury respecting the ownership of a castle,
in which the combat was adjudged. When the champions
entered the lists the customary examination of their arms and
accoutrements was made, and the combat was adjourned in
consequence, as it was said, of finding in the coat of the episcopal
champion certain rolls containing prayers and charms.
The case was finally compromised by the bishop paying fifteen
hundred marks to the earl for the disputed property.<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> That
precautions against such devices were deemed necessary is
shown by the oath required of all combatants, whether principals
or champions, that they had on them no charms or conjurations
to affect the result.<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> A quaint formula for this is the
oath of the champion in the case of Low <i>vs.</i> Paramore in 1571—“This
hear you justices that I have this day neither eat,
drunk, nor have upon me either bone, stone, ne glass or any
enchantment, sorcery, or witchcraft where-through the power
of the Word of God might be inleased or diminished and
the devil’s power increased, and that my appeal is true, so
help me God and his saints and by this Book.”<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<small>LIMITATIONS ON THE WAGER OF BATTLE.</small></h3>


<p>The right of demanding the wager of battle between principals
varied much with the age and race, though as a “bilateral”
ordeal, as a rule, from the earliest times either party was entitled
to claim it.<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> When Beaumanoir composed his <i>Coutumes
du Beauvoisis</i>, in 1283, the practice may be considered to
have entered upon its decadence; twenty years had elapsed
since the determined efforts of St. Louis to abolish it; substitutes
for it in legal processes had been provided; and the
manner in which that enlightened jurist manifests his preference
for peaceful forms of law shows that he fully appreciated
the civilizing spirit in which the monarch had endeavored to
soften the ferocity of his subjects. When, therefore, we see
in Beaumanoir’s treatise how few restrictions existed in his
time, we may comprehend the previous universality of the
custom. In criminal cases, if an accuser offered battle, the
defendant was forced either to accept it or to confess his guilt,
unless he could prove an alibi, or unless the accuser was himself
notoriously guilty of the crime in question, and the accusation
was evidently a mere device to shift the guilt to the
shoulders of another; or unless, in case of murder, the victim
had disculpated him, when dying, and had named the real
criminals.<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> If, on the other hand, the accused demanded to
wage his battle, the judge could only refuse it when his guilt
was too notorious for question.<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> A serf could not challenge a
freeman, nor a bastard a man of legitimate birth (though an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
appeal of battle might lie between two bastards), nor a leper a
sound man.<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> In civil actions, the battle trial was not allowed
in cases relating to dower, to orphans under age,<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> to guardianships,
or to the equity of redemption afforded by the feudal
laws to kinsmen in the sale of heritable property, or where
the matter at stake was of less value than twelve deniers.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>
St. Louis also prohibited the duel between brothers in civil
cases, while permitting it in criminal accusations.<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> The
slenderness of these restrictions shows what ample opportunities
were afforded to belligerent pleaders.<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>In Germany, as a general rule, either party had a right to
demand the judicial combat,<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> subject, however, in practice, to
several important limitations. Thus, difference of rank between
the parties afforded the superior a right to decline a
challenge, as we shall see more fully hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> Relationship
between the contestants was also an impediment, of which
either might avail himself,<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> and even the fact that the defendant
was not a native of the territory in which the action was
brought gave him the privilege of refusing the appeal.<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
we find the principle laid down even in the fourteenth century
that cases of homicide could not be determined in any other
manner.<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> There were circumstances, indeed, in which the
complainant, if he could bring the evidence of seven witnesses
in his favor, could decline the duel; but if he choose to
prove the charge by the combat, no examination or testimony
was admitted. In the same way, if a man was slain while
committing theft or robbery, and was prosecuted for the crime,
the accuser was not bound to offer the duel if he could produce
the evidence of seven witnesses; but if a relative of the
dead man offered to vindicate him by combat, this annulled
all the evidence, and conviction could not be had without the
battle ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> A curious provision in the Saxon burgher law
allowed a man who had been assaulted to challenge to the
duel as many men as he had wounds—but the wounds were
required to be of a certain degree of severity—<i>wunden kampffbaren</i>.<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>
So the contemporary law of Suabia provides that in
accusations of personal violence, the duel was not to be
allowed, unless the injury inflicted on the complainant had
been sufficiently serious to cause permanent maiming,<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> thus
showing how thoroughly different in spirit was the judicial
combat from the modern code of honor which has been
affiliated upon it. Yet a general rule is found expressed to
the effect that it was necessary only in cases where no other
evidence was obtainable, when the result could be safely left
to the judgment of Omniscience.<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>In the Latin kingdoms of the East, and among the Armenians,
who, curiously enough, adopted the customs of their
fellow Christians from the West, it would seem that in both
the noble and the roturier courts, in civil as well as in criminal
cases, the plaintiff or prosecutor was not obliged personally to
fight, but that if one of his witnesses offered battle, the defendant
or accused was not permitted to decline the challenge
under pain of losing his suit or being condemned. On the
other hand, unless the complainant or accuser had a witness
who was willing to offer battle, the oath of denial of the other
party was sufficient, and in criminal cases the accuser was
subjected to the <i>talio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>By the English law of the thirteenth century, a man accused
of crime had, in doubtful cases only, the right of election
between trial by jury and the wager of battle. When a violent
presumption existed against him, he was obliged to submit
to the verdict of a jury; but in cases of suspected poisoning,
as satisfactory evidence was deemed unattainable, the
accused had only the choice between confession and the combat.<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a>
On the other hand, when the appellant demanded the
duel, he was obliged to make out a probable case before it
was granted.<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> When battle had been gaged, however, no
withdrawal was permitted, and any composition between the
parties to avoid it was punishable by fine and imprisonment<a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>—a
regulation, no doubt, intended to prevent pleaders from
rashly undertaking it, and to obviate its abuse as a means of
extortion. In accusations of treason, indeed, the royal consent
alone could prevent the matter from being fought out.<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>
Any bodily injury on the part of the plaintiff, tending to
render him less capable of defence or aggression, likewise
deprived the defendant of the right to the wager of battle,
and this led to such nice distinctions that the loss of molar
teeth was adjudged not to amount to disqualification, while
the absence of incisors was considered sufficient excuse, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>cause
they were held to be important weapons of offence.<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>
Notwithstanding these various restrictions, cases of treason
were almost always determined by the judicial duel, according
to both Glanville and Bracton.<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> This was in direct opposition
to the custom of Lombardy, where such cases were especially
exempted from decision by the sword.<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> These restrictions
of the English law, such as they were, did not, however,
extend to the Scottish Marches, where the trial by battle was
the universal resource and no proof by witnesses was admitted.<a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p>In Bearn, the duel was permitted at the option of the accuser
in cases of murder and treason, but in civil suits only in
default of testimony.<a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> That in such cases it was in common
use is shown by a treaty made, in the latter part of the eleventh
century, between Centulla I. of Bearn and the Viscount of
Soule, in which all doubtful questions arising between their
respective subjects are directed to be settled by the combat,
with the singular proviso that the combatants shall be men
who have never taken part in war.<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> In the thirteenth century,
however, a provision occurs which must have greatly reduced
the number of duels, as it imposed a fine of only sixteen sous
on the party who made default, while, if vanquished, he was
visited with a mulct of sixty sous and the forfeiture of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> In the neighboring region of Bigorre an exemption
was allowed in favor of the widow whose husband had been
slain in war. Until she remarried or her sons were of age to
bear arms she was exempt from all legal process—a provision
evidently intended to relieve her from the duel in which
suits were liable to terminate.<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>In some regions greater restrictions were imposed on the
facility for such appeals to the sword. In Catalonia, for instance,
the judge alone had the power of deciding whether
they should be permitted,<a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> and a similar right was reserved
in doubtful cases to the podestà in a code of laws in force at
Verona in 1228.<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> This must often have prevented the injustice
inherent in the system, and an equally prudent reserve
was exhibited in a statute of Montpellier, which required the
assent of both parties.<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> On the other hand, in Normandy,
at the commencement of the thirteenth century, many cases
relating to real estate were examined in the first instance by
a jury of twelve men, and, if they failed of an unanimous
verdict, the question was decided by the duel, whether the
parties were willing or not.<a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></p>

<p>By the criminal procedure in England, at about the same
period, the duel was prescribed only for cases of felony or
crimes of importance, and it was forbidden in trifling misdemeanors.<a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a>
Appeal of battle could not lie between a vassal
and his lord during the existence of the connection, nor between
a serf and his master except in cases of treason.<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> It
would also seem that the defendant could avoid the duel if he
could prove that the motive of the appeal was hatred, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
there is a curious case on record in which, when the appellant
demanded battle, the accused offered to the king a silver mark
for an impartial jury to decide this preliminary question, and
it was granted to him.<a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> In Southern Germany a fifteenth century
MS. enumerates seven crimes for which the duel could
be prescribed—detraction of the emperor or empire, treason,
theft, robbery and depredation, rape, arson, and poisoning.<a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p>From a very early period, a minimum limit of value was
established, below which a pugnacious pleader was not allowed
to put the life or limb of his adversary in jeopardy.
This varied of course with the race and the period. Thus,
among the Angli and Werini, the lowest sum for which the
combat was permitted was two solidi,<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> while the Baioarians
established the limit at the value of a cow.<a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> In the tenth
century, Otho II. decided that six solidi should be the smallest
sum worth fighting for.<a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> The so-called laws of Henry I. of
England decreed that in civil cases the appeal of battle should
not lie for an amount less than ten solidi.<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> In France, Louis
le Jeune, by an edict of 1168, forbade the duel when the sum
in debate was less than five sous,<a id="FNanchor_432_432" href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> and this remained in force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
for at least a century.<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The custom of Normandy in the
thirteenth century specifies ten sous as the line of demarcation
between the <i>lex apparens</i> and the <i>lex simplex</i> in civil suits,<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a>
and the same provision retains its place in the Coutumier in
use until the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> In the Latin States of the
East founded by the Crusaders, the minimum was a silver
marc in cases of both nobles and roturiers.<a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> A law of Aragon,
in 1247, places the limit at ten sous.<a id="FNanchor_437_437" href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p>As regards the inferior classes of society, innumerable documents
attest the right of peasants to decide their quarrels by
the ordeal of battle. By the old Lombard law, slaves were
allowed to defend themselves in this manner;<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> and they could
even employ the duel to claim their liberty from their masters,
as we may infer from a law of King Grimoald denying this
privilege to those who could be proved to have served the same
master for thirty continuous years.<a id="FNanchor_439_439" href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> Similarly, among the
Frisians, a <i>litus</i> claiming his liberty was allowed to prove it
against his master with arms.<a id="FNanchor_440_440" href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> The institutions of feudalism
widened the distance between the different classes of society,
and we have already seen that, in the thirteenth century, serfs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
were enfranchised in order to enable them to support their testimony
by the combat; yet this was only the result of inequality
of rank. In the time of Beaumanoir (1283), though an appeal
would not lie from a serf to a freeman, it may be safely inferred
from the context that a combat could be legally decreed between
two serfs if the consent of their masters were obtained,<a id="FNanchor_441_441" href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>
and other contemporary authorities show that a man claimed
as a serf could defend his freedom with the sword against his
would-be master.<a id="FNanchor_442_442" href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> Even Jews were held liable to the appeal
of battle, as we learn from a decision of 1207, preserved in
an ancient register of assizes in Normandy,<a id="FNanchor_443_443" href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> and they no doubt
purchased the exemption, which was granted to them, except
in cases of flagrant murder, by Philippe le Long, as a special
favor, in 1317.<a id="FNanchor_444_444" href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p>Difference of condition thus became an impediment to the
duel, and formed the subject of many regulations, varying
with circumstance and locality. The free mountaineers of
Béarn, as has been seen, placed the prince and the subject on
an equality before the law, but this was a rare example of
independence, and the privileges of station were sometimes
exhibited in their most odious form. In France, for instance,
while the battle trial could take place between the gentilhomme
and the <i>vilain</i>, the former was secured by the distinction that
if the villein presumed to challenge him, he enjoyed the right
of fighting on horseback with knightly weapons, while the
challenger was on foot and armed only with shield and staff;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
but if the gentleman condescended to challenge the villein,
they met on equal terms.<a id="FNanchor_445_445" href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> This last regulation was enforced
with impartial justice, for Beaumanoir mentions a case in which
a gentleman challenged a roturier, and presented himself in
the lists mounted and armed with his knightly weapons. The
defendant protested against this illegal advantage, and the
judges decided that the gentleman had forfeited his horse and
arms, and that if he desired to continue the combat he must
do so in the condition in which he was left by the disarmament—in
his shirt without armor or weapons, while his adversary
should retain coat of mail, target, and club.<a id="FNanchor_446_446" href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> The barbarous
injustice of the general rule, moreover, was by no
means of universal application. Pierre de Fontaines, for
instance, directs that in cases of appeal from a roturier to a
gentleman the combat shall take place on foot between champions;<a id="FNanchor_447_447" href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>
and I find a case recorded in 1280, in which a <i>femme
de corps</i> of Aimeri de Rochechouart accused the Sire de
Montricher of burning her houses, and as the duel was adjudged
she placed in the lists an armed and mounted knight
as her champion, to whom no objection seems to have been
made.<a id="FNanchor_448_448" href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></p>

<p>Throughout both Northern and Southern Germany, where
the minute distinctions of birth were guarded with the most
jealous care from a very early period, the codes of the thirteenth
century, including even the burgher laws, provided that
a difference of rank permitted the superior to decline the
challenge of an inferior, while the latter was obliged to accept
the appeal of the former. So thoroughly was this principle
carried into practice, that, to compel the appearance of a
<i>Semperfri</i>, or noble of sixteen quarterings, the appellant was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
required to prove himself of equally untarnished descent.<a id="FNanchor_449_449" href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> In
the same spirit a Jew could not decline the appeal of battle
offered by a Christian accuser, though we may safely infer
that the Jew could not challenge the Christian.<a id="FNanchor_450_450" href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> So, in the
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, the Greek, the Syrian, and the
Saracen could not challenge the Frank, but could not, in
criminal cases, decline his challenge, though they might do
so in civil suits.<a id="FNanchor_451_451" href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> In Aragon, no judicial duel was permitted
between a Christian and a Jew or a Saracen,<a id="FNanchor_452_452" href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> while in Castile
both combatants had to be gentlemen, quarrels between parties
of different ranks being settled by the courts.<a id="FNanchor_453_453" href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> On the other
hand, in Wales, extreme difference of rank was held to render
the duel necessary, as in cases of treason against a lord, for
there the lord was plaintiff against his vassal, and as no man
could enter into law with his lord, the combat was considered
the only mode of prosecution befitting his dignity.<a id="FNanchor_454_454" href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>A question of this nature was the remote occasion of the
murder of Charles the Good, Count of Flanders, in 1127.
Bertulf, Provost of the church of Bruges, was rich and powerful,
although in reality his family were villeins of the count.
He married his nieces to knights, one of whom, in presence of
the count, appealed another knight to battle. The appellee
refused on the ground that he was not obliged to notice the
challenge of a villein, for according to the law of the land a
freeman marrying a serf was reduced to the latter condition
after the expiration of a year. The Count’s attention being
thus called to his rights over the family of Bertulf, he proceeded
to establish them, when Bertulf set on foot the conspiracy
which ended in the assassination of the count.<a id="FNanchor_455_455" href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were three classes—women, ecclesiastics, and those
suffering under physical incapacity—with whom personal appearance
in the lists would appear to be impossible. When
interested in cases involving the judicial duel they were therefore
allowed the privilege of substituting a champion, who
took their place and did battle for the justice of their cause.
So careful were legislators to prevent any failure in the procedure
prescribed by custom, that the North German law
provided that the dead when prosecuted could appear in the
lists by substitutes,<a id="FNanchor_456_456" href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and the Assises de Jerusalem ordered the
suzerain to supply the expenses for forty days, when a suitor
unable to fight was also too poor to pay for a champion to
take his place; and when a murdered man left no relatives to
prosecute the murderer, the suzerain was likewise obliged to
furnish the champion in any trial that might arise.<a id="FNanchor_457_457" href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> Equally
directed to the same purpose was the German law which provided
that when a crippled defendant refused or neglected to
procure a substitute, the judge was to seize one-half of his
property with which to pay the services of a gladiator, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
could claim nothing more.<a id="FNanchor_458_458" href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> Guardians of women and minors,
moreover, were bound to furnish battle in their behalf.<a id="FNanchor_459_459" href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>Women, however, did not always restrict themselves to
fighting thus vicariously. The German laws refer to cases
in which a woman might demand justice of a man personally
in the lists, and not only are instances on record in which this
was done, as in a case at Berne in 1228, in which the woman
was the victor,<a id="FNanchor_460_460" href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> but it was of sufficiently frequent occurrence
to have an established mode of procedure, which is preserved
to us in all its details by illuminated MSS. of the period.<a id="FNanchor_461_461" href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
The chances between such unequal adversaries were adjusted
by placing the man up to the navel in a pit three feet wide,
tying his left hand behind his back, and arming him only with
a club, while his fair opponent had the free use of her limbs
and was furnished with a stone as large as the fist, or
weighing from one to five pounds, fastened in a piece of
stuff. A curious regulation provided the man with three clubs.
If in delivering a blow he touched the earth with hand or arm
he forfeited one of the clubs; if this happened thrice his last
weapon was gone, he was adjudged defeated, and the woman
could order his execution. On the other hand, the woman was
similarly furnished with three weapons. If she struck the
man while he was disarmed she forfeited one, and with the
loss of the third she was at his mercy, and was liable to be
buried alive. According to the customs of Freisingen these
combats were reserved for accusations of rape. If the man
was vanquished, he was beheaded; if the woman, she only
lost a hand, for the reason that the chances of the fight were
against her.<a id="FNanchor_462_462" href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> In Bohemia, also, women over the age of eighteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
had the privilege of the duel; the man was put into a pit as
deep as his waist; the woman was armed with sword and
buckler, but was not allowed to approach nearer than a circle
traced around the mouth of the pit.<a id="FNanchor_463_463" href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>The liability of ecclesiastics to the duel varied with the
varying relations between the church and state. As early as
the year 819, Louis le Débonnaire, in his additions to the
Salic law, directs that, in doubtful cases arising between laymen
and ecclesiastics, the duel between chosen witnesses shall
be employed, but that when both parties are clerical it shall be
forbidden.<a id="FNanchor_464_464" href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> This restriction was not long observed. A decree
of the Emperor Guy, in 892, gives to churchmen the
privilege of settling their quarrels either by combat or by witnesses,
as they might prefer;<a id="FNanchor_465_465" href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> and, about the year 945, Atto
of Vercelli complains that the tribunals allowed to ecclesiastics
no exemption from the prevailing custom.<a id="FNanchor_466_466" href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> As we have
seen (p. 131), Otho II., at the Council of Verona in 983, subjected
the churches to the law of the duel, only granting them
the privilege of employing champions. Some intricate questions
involved in the coexistence of the Lombard and the
Roman law arose in a celebrated case between the Abbey of
Farfa and that of SS. Cosmo and Damianus of Rome, which
was pleaded in 998 and 999 before Otho III. and Popes
Gregory V. and Sylvester II. The Abbey of Farfa proved
that it lived under the Lombard law, while the other was
under the Roman law. It was decided, as the Abbey of Farfa
desired, that after hearing testimony the case should be settled
by the duel, but the witnesses of the Roman abbey were so
manifestly perjured that it was held not to have made out a
case justifying an appeal to the combat, and the churches in
dispute were adjudged to Farfa.<a id="FNanchor_467_467" href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p>

<p>So far was this liability to the duel from being deemed a
hardship by the turbulent spirits of the period, that clerks not
infrequently disdained to sustain their rights by the interven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>tion
of a champion, and boldly entered the lists themselves.
In 1080 the Synod of Lillebonne adopted a canon punishing
by a fine such belligerent churchmen as indulged in the luxury
of duels without having first obtained from their bishops
a special license authorizing it.<a id="FNanchor_468_468" href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> About the same period,
Geoffrey, Abbot of Vendôme, in a letter to the Bishop of
Saintes, complains of one of his monks who had fought in a
judicial duel with a clerk of Saintes.<a id="FNanchor_469_469" href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> The practice continued,
and though forbidden by Pope Innocent II. in 1140,<a id="FNanchor_470_470" href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
Alexander III. and Clement III. found it necessary to repeat
the prohibition before the close of the century.<a id="FNanchor_471_471" href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> Yet Alexander,
when appealed to with respect to a priest of the Campagna
who had lost a finger in a duel, decided that neither
the offence nor the mutilation debarred him from the exercise
of his sacerdotal functions, and only directed him to undergo
due penance.<a id="FNanchor_472_472" href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> The progress of the age, however, was shown
when, about thirty years afterwards, Celestin III. pronounced
sentence of deposition in a similar case submitted to him;<a id="FNanchor_473_473" href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
and this was formally and peremptorily confirmed by Innocent
III. at the great council of Lateran in 1215.<a id="FNanchor_474_474" href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>That the peaceful ministers of Christ should vindicate their
rights with the sword, either personally or by proxy, was a
sacrilege abhorrent to pious minds. As early as the middle of
the ninth century, Nicholas I., who did so much to establish
the supremacy of the church, endeavored to emancipate it
from this necessity, and declared that the duel was not recognized
by ecclesiastical law.<a id="FNanchor_475_475" href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> The utmost privilege which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
secular law accorded the clergy, however, was the right of
presenting a champion in the lists, which zealous churchmen
naturally resented as an arbitrary injustice.<a id="FNanchor_476_476" href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> How thoroughly
it was carried out in practice, notwithstanding all remonstrances,
is shown by a charter granted in 1024 by St. Stephen
of Hungary to the monastery of St. Adrian of Zala, by which,
among other privileges, the pious king bound himself to supply
a champion in all suits against the abbey, in order that the
holy meditations of the monks might not be interrupted.<a id="FNanchor_477_477" href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> Not
long after, in 1033, the celebrated abbey of St. Clement at
Pescara was involved in a dispute concerning some lands
which had been cut off from its possessions by a change in the
course of the river Pescara, and had been seized by the lords
of the contiguous territory. At an assembly of the magnates
of the district it was adjudged that the matter must be settled
by the duel. The night before the combat was to take place
the holy abbot Guido, after enjoining earnest prayers by all
the monks, sallied forth alone to the banks of the stream and
stretching forth his staff adjured the waters to repair the evil
which they had wrought under the impulsion of the devil.
The river forthwith returned to its old channel, and next
morning the multitude which assembled to witness the combat
were astounded to see the miracle. The godless men who had
seized on the possessions of the church humbly sought pardon
for their sin, and the abbey remained in quiet enjoyment of
its rights.<a id="FNanchor_478_478" href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></p>

<p>The scandal of maintaining the claims of the church by
carnal weapons and bloodshed was not soon suppressed. In
1112 we find a certain Guillaume Maumarel, in a dispute
with the chapter of Paris concerning some feudal rights over
the domain of Sucy, appearing in the court of the Bishop of
Paris for the purpose of settling the question by the duel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
though the matter was finally compromised without combat,
there does not seem to have been anything irregular in his
proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_479_479" href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> So, about the same period, in a case between
the abbey of St. Aubin in Anjou and a neighboring knight,
involving some rights of property, the monks not only challenged
their adversary, but the duel was held in the seignorial
court of another monastery;<a id="FNanchor_480_480" href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> and in 1164, we find a duel
decreed at Monza, by the Archbishop of Cologne as chancellor
of Italy, between an abbey and a layman of the vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_481_481" href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a>
That such cases, indeed, were by no means uncommon is
shown by their special prohibition in 1195 by Celestin III.<a id="FNanchor_482_482" href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
Yet, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of the Holy See, it
was almost impossible for the church to exempt itself from the
universal liability. Though in 1174 Louis VII. granted a
special privilege of exemption to the church of Jusiers and its
men, on the ground that he was bound to abrogate all improper
customs,<a id="FNanchor_483_483" href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> still no general reform appears to have been practicable.
An important step was gained when in 1176 Henry
II., as a concession to the papacy, agreed that ecclesiastics
should not be forced to the duel,<a id="FNanchor_484_484" href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> but this did not extend to the
Scottish Marches, where by law an ecclesiastic was as liable as a
layman to personal appearance in the lists; if he presented a
champion he was held in custody till the event of the duel,
when, if the champion was defeated, his principal was promptly
beheaded. Innocent III. sternly prohibited this in 1216, but
ineffectually, as is seen by a complaint of the English clergy,
in 1237, in which they mention the case of the Prior of Lide,
who had thus recently suffered the penalty. This was equally
fruitless, for the <i>Leges Marchiarum</i>, enacted in 1249, declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
that exemption from battle is confined to the persons of the
kings and of the Bishops of St. Andrews and Durham.<a id="FNanchor_485_485" href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></p>

<p>In France, during the thirteenth century, the liability continued.
In 1239 a knight of Orleans, Gui de Santillac, testified
before the royal council that the chapter of Saint-Aignan had
appealed him in wager of battle.<a id="FNanchor_486_486" href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> As late as the year 1245,
some vassals of the chapter of Nôtre Dame at Paris denied
the service due by them, and demanded that the claim of the
chapter should be made good by the wager of battle. That
they had a legal right to do so is shown by the fact that the
churchmen were obliged to implore the intervention of the
pope; and Innocent IV. accordingly granted to the chapter
a special privilege, in which, on the ground that single combats
were forbidden by the canons, he declared that the church
of Nôtre Dame should be entitled to prove its rights by witnesses,
deeds, and other legitimate proofs, notwithstanding the
custom existing to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_487_487" href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> It was probably his interference
in this case that led him a few years later, in 1252, to
issue a decretal in which he pointed out the manifest hardship
of forcing the clergy in France, when prosecuting such claims
against their serfs, to have recourse to the duel, and thus,
under the canon law, to forfeit their positions. To remedy
this he proclaimed as a general rule that all verdicts should be
void when obtained against clerks either by means of the duel
or through reason of their refusing the combat;<a id="FNanchor_488_488" href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> yet in the
following year he was obliged to intervene to protect the Archbishop
of Sens, who complained that in these cases he was
obliged to make good his claims by battle.<a id="FNanchor_489_489" href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> In this, Innocent
was consistent, for one of the accusations which he had brought
against the Emperor Frederic II. when the latter was deposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
at the Council of Lyons in 1245 was that he had forced
ecclesiastics to undergo the duel, to the confusion of all distinctions
between clerk and layman.<a id="FNanchor_490_490" href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Even in Italy about 1220
the podestà of Florence ordered the duel to decide a suit
concerning certain property between some citizens and the
church of the Apostles; the latter invoked the intervention
of Honorius III., who commanded the matter to be settled
by regular judicial process, boldly alleging that the duel
was unheard of in such matters,<a id="FNanchor_491_491" href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> but in spite of this and
the repeated prohibitions of the popes, trial by combat was
still towards the close of the thirteenth century regarded
as the only mode of settling disputed questions between
churches when the genuineness of a charter was impugned.<a id="FNanchor_492_492" href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a>
Yet at the same period the doctors of canon law held that
an ecclesiastic appearing in the lists, either personally or
by a champion, was subject to deposition; it was better,
they said, to lose lands and fiefs than to incur mortal
sin. Unfortunately this was scarce more than a mere <i>brutum
fulmen</i>, for a dispensation could always be had from bishop
or pope.<a id="FNanchor_493_493" href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> Custom was stubborn, moreover, and half a century
later, when the judicial duel was going out of fashion, a bishop
of Liége so vexed the burghers of Louvain, by repeated citations
to the combat to settle disputed questions, that John III.
Duke of Brabant was obliged to appeal to the Emperor Charles
IV., who accordingly wrote to the bishops of Trèves, Cambrai,
and Verdun desiring them to find some means of putting
an end to the bellicose tendencies of their episcopal brother.<a id="FNanchor_494_494" href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a></p>

<p>These sporadic cases only show how difficult it was through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>out
the whole extent of Christendom to eradicate a custom so
deeply rooted in ancestral modes of thought. By the middle
of the thirteenth century the church had succeeded in virtually
establishing the claim, for which it had long striven, that
ecclesiastics were not subject to secular law in either civil or
criminal matters. This exemption of course released them
from liability to the duel and placed them exclusively under
spiritual jurisdiction, in which the strongly marked papal
aversion to the duel had full opportunity of making itself
effective.<a id="FNanchor_495_495" href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></p>

<p>Another phase of the relations between the church and the
duel is to be seen in the extensive secular jurisdiction of its
prelates in their capacity as temporal seigneurs. In this they
were accustomed to award the duel as freely as any other form
of legal procedure. To do this was not only one of the
privileges which marked the feudal superior, but was also a
source of revenue from the fees and penalties thence accruing,
and these rights were as eagerly sought and as jealously
guarded by the spiritual lords as by the warlike barons. It
would scarce be necessary to multiply instances, but I may
mention a charter granted by Fulk Nera, Count of Anjou,
about the year 1010, bestowing these rights on the abbey of
Beaulieu in Touraine,<a id="FNanchor_496_496" href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> and one by the Emperor Henry III.,
in 1052, to the bishop and church of Volterra in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_497_497" href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
first authentic evidence of the existence of the battle trial in
Scotland is a charter of Alexander I. in 1124 to the Abbey of
Scone, in which he bestows on the abbot and monks the right
to grant the duel and ordeal in their jurisdiction; and his
brother, St. David I., conferred the same rights on the Abbey
of Holyrood.<a id="FNanchor_498_498" href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Some conscientious churchmen objected to a
practice so antagonistic to all the teachings of the religion of
which they were professors, and lifted up their voices to check
the abuse. Thus, about the close of the eleventh century, we
find the celebrated canonist, St. Ivo of Chartres, rebuking the
Bishop of Orleans for ordering the combat to decide an important
suit in his court.<a id="FNanchor_499_499" href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> Ivo even carried out his principles
to the sacrifice of the jurisdiction usually so dear to the prelates
of his day, for in another case he refused to give judgment
because it necessarily involved a trial by battle, and he
eluded the responsibility by transferring the cause to the court
of the Countess of Chartres.<a id="FNanchor_500_500" href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> A century later Peter Cantor
declared that as a priest he would in no case furnish relics on
which the preliminary oaths were to be taken, for churchmen
were prohibited from being concerned in bloodshed.<a id="FNanchor_501_501" href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> These
precepts and examples were equally unavailing. Churchmen
continued to award the wager of battle, and resolutely resisted
any invasion of their privileges. In 1150 the statutes of the
chapter of Lausanne direct that all duels shall be fought before
the provost—and the provost was Arducius, Bishop of Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_502_502" href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a>
In 1201 we see the Abbot of St. Alban’s and the Abbot of
Westminster pleading as to their rights over the manor of
Aldenham, including that of the duel.<a id="FNanchor_503_503" href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> Even in the thirteenth
century, in the archbishop’s court or officiality of Reims, the
duel was a matter of course;<a id="FNanchor_504_504" href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> and a case is recorded, occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>ring
in 1224, in a dispute about the ownership of a house,
which was decided by a duel in the court of the abbey of St.
Remy, where the abbot presided over the lists and they were
guarded by the royal officials.<a id="FNanchor_505_505" href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> In 1239 the Bishop of Orleans
contested with the king as to the right of the former to
the jurisdiction of the duel in his diocese;<a id="FNanchor_506_506" href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> and in a judgment
rendered in 1269, concerning a combat waged within the
limits of the chapter of Nôtre Dame of Paris, we find that the
first blows of the fight, usually known as <i>ictus regis</i> or
<i>les cous lou roi</i>, are alluded to as <i>ictus capituli</i>.<a id="FNanchor_507_507" href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> How
eagerly these rights were maintained is apparent from numerous
decisions concerning contested cases. Thus, an agreement
of 1193, between the Countess of St. Quentin and the
chapter of Nôtre Dame, respecting the disputed jurisdiction
of the town of Viry, gives the official of the chapter the right
to decree duels, but places the lists under the supervision of
both parties, and divides the spoils equally between each.<a id="FNanchor_508_508" href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> A
charter of 1199, concerning the village of Marne, shows that
the sergeant, or officer of the chapter, had the cognizance of
causes up to the gaging of battle, after which further proceedings
were reserved for the court of the bishop himself.<a id="FNanchor_509_509" href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> In
1219 the commune of Novara arrogated to itself the right of
decreeing the duel, but the bishop resisted this invasion of his
privileges, and on the matter being referred for arbitration to
the Bishop of Turin he decided in favor of his episcopal
brother. The Bishop of Modena had a long and expensive
suit with his city on the same question, which ended in 1227<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
with a compromise by which he abandoned the right; the
Bishops of Vercelli were more fortunate, for they maintained
it until the beginning of the fourteenth century, when judicial
duels were going out of fashion.<a id="FNanchor_510_510" href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> In 1257, while St. Louis
was exerting himself with so much energy to restrict the custom,
an abbey is found engaged in a suit with the crown to
prove its rights to decree the duel, and to enjoy the fees and
mulcts thence arising;<a id="FNanchor_511_511" href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> and in 1277 a similar suit on the part
of the abbey of St. Vaast d’Arras was decided in its favor.<a id="FNanchor_512_512" href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a>
From a verdict given in 1293, the right of the chapter of
Soissons to decree the judicial combat appears to be undoubted,
as well as the earnestness of the worthy ecclesiastics to exercise
the privilege.<a id="FNanchor_513_513" href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Even more significant is a declaration of the
authorities of Metz, as late as 1299, by which the granting of
all wagers of battle is expressly admitted by the civil magistrates
of the city to appertain to the court of the archbishop;<a id="FNanchor_514_514" href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a>
and even in 1311 a bishop of St. Brieuc ordered a duel between
two squires pleading in his court, in consequence of
high words between them. From some cause the combat did
not take place, and the Christian prelate seized the arms and
horses of the parties as his mulct. They appealed to the Parlement
of Paris, which ordered the restoration of the confiscated
articles, and fined the bishop for his disregard of the
royal edicts prohibiting the single combat.<a id="FNanchor_515_515" href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> Not long before,
Beaumanoir had definitely asserted that the church could not
be concerned in cases which involved the judicial duel, or the
infliction of death or mutilation;<a id="FNanchor_516_516" href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> but the church was not disposed
to admit this limitation on its jurisdiction, and in spite
of the attempted suppression of the wager of battle by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
crown it continued in its multifarious capacity of seigneur to
execute the cruel laws of the period with undiminished activity.<a id="FNanchor_517_517" href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>In other lands, where the duel had not experienced as in
France the hostility of the supreme power, prelates continued
to decree it, regardless of the papal anathemas. It was to no
purpose that canon lawyers proved that they thereby incurred
mortal sin, and that if death ensued they became “irregular”
and incompetent to perform divine service. To all this they
turned a deaf ear, and John of Freiburg, towards the close of
the thirteenth century, is reduced to wishing that preachers
would expound these principles in the pulpit and make them
understood by the people at large.<a id="FNanchor_518_518" href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was one jurisdiction which held itself more carefully
aloof from the prevailing influence of barbarism—that of the
Admiralty Courts, which covered a large portion of practical
mercantile law. This is a fact easily explicable, not only from
the character of the parties and of the transactions for which
those courts were erected, but from the direct descent of the
maritime codes from the Roman law, less modified by transmission
than any other portions of mediæval jurisprudence.
These codes, though compiled at a period when the wager of
battle flourished in full luxuriance, have no reference to it
whatever, and the Assises de Jerusalem expressly allude to the
Admiralty Courts as not admitting the judicial duel in proof,<a id="FNanchor_519_519" href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a>
while an English document of 12 Edward III. attests the same
principle.<a id="FNanchor_520_520" href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> When, however, the case was one implying an
accusation of theft or deception, as in denying the receipt of
cargo, the matter entered into the province of criminal law,
and the battle trial might be legitimately ordered.<a id="FNanchor_521_521" href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<small>REGULATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.</small></h3>


<p>The forms and ceremonies employed in the judicial duel
may furnish an interesting subject of investigation for the
admirers of chivalry, but they teach in their details little concerning
the habits and modes of thought of the Middle Ages,
and for the most part are therefore interesting only to the pure
archæologist. Although minute directions have come down
to us in the manuals compiled for the guidance of judges of
the lists, to enumerate them in their varying fashions would
hardly be worth the necessary space. Yet there are some
details which are of interest as illustrating both the theory and
practice of the duel in its legal aspect. Thus the general principle
on which the combat was conducted was the absolute
assertion by each party of the justice of his cause, confirmed
by a solemn oath on the Gospels, or on a relic of approved
sanctity, before the conflict commenced.<a id="FNanchor_522_522" href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> Defeat was thus not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
merely the loss of the suit, but was also a conviction of perjury,
to be punished as such; and in criminal cases it was also a
conviction of malicious prosecution on the part of a worsted
appellant. That it was regarded as much more serious than
the simple loss of a suit is shown by the provisions of the
custom of Normandy, whereby a vanquished combatant was
classed with perjurers, false witnesses, and other infamous
persons, as incapable thenceforth of giving evidence in courts,
or of serving on a jury.<a id="FNanchor_523_523" href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> Accordingly, we find the vanquished
party, whether plaintiff or defendant, subjected to penalties
more or less severe, varying with time and place.</p>

<p>This was a primeval custom, even in civil cases. In the
ancient laws of the Alamanni, when there was controversy as
to the ownership of land, the contestants brought to the court
of the district some earth and branches of trees from the disputed
property. These were wrapped and sealed and placed
in the lists, where the combatants touched the bundle with
their swords and called upon God to grant victory to the right;
the land passed to the victor and the defeated party was fined
twelve sous for having made an unjust claim.<a id="FNanchor_524_524" href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> The tendency,
as civilization advanced, was to render the penalty more severe.
Thus, in 819, Louis le Débonnaire decreed that, in cases
where testimony was evenly balanced, one of the witnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
from each side should be chosen to fight it out, the defeated
champion suffering the usual penalty of perjury—the loss of a
hand; while the remaining witnesses on the losing side were
allowed the privilege of redeeming their forfeited members at
the regular legal rate.<a id="FNanchor_525_525" href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> William the Conqueror imposed a fine
of forty sous on the losing side impartially;<a id="FNanchor_526_526" href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> this was increased
to sixty sous by the compilation known as the laws of Henry
I.;<a id="FNanchor_527_527" href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> and the same regulation is stated by Glanville, with the
addition that the defeated person was forever disqualified as a
witness or champion;<a id="FNanchor_528_528" href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> but in practice the amount seems to
have been indefinite, for in the Pipe Rolls the fines levied for
<i>recreantise</i> vary from one mark to a hundred.<a id="FNanchor_529_529" href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> In a case
occurring in 1221 where the defendant was victorious the
record simply states that the appellant was ordered into custody;<a id="FNanchor_530_530" href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a>
while in the time of Edward II. the loser, except in
cases of felony, paid to the victor forty sous besides a small
gratification under the name of <i>ruaille</i>, in addition to the loss
of the suit.<a id="FNanchor_531_531" href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> By the Lombard customs, early in the eleventh
century, the appellant, if vanquished, had the privilege of redeeming
his hand; the defendant, if defeated, lost his hand,
and was of course subject in addition to the penalties of the
crime of which he was proved guilty.<a id="FNanchor_532_532" href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> About the same time
the Béarnese legislation is more merciful, a fine of sixty-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
sous Morlaas being imposed impartially on the losing party.<a id="FNanchor_533_533" href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>
In process of time this system was abandoned in some countries.
The English law of the thirteenth century admitted the
justice of the <i>lex talionis</i> in principle, but did not put it in
practice, a vanquished appellant in capital cases being merely
imprisoned as a calumniator, while the defendant, if defeated,
was executed and his property confiscated.<a id="FNanchor_534_534" href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> The same distinction
is to be found in the contemporary custom of Normandy.<a id="FNanchor_535_535" href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a>
So, by the code in force in Verona in 1228, the
Podestà in criminal cases had the power of ordering the duel,
and of punishing at his pleasure the accuser if vanquished—the
accused when convicted of course undergoing the penalty
of his crime.<a id="FNanchor_536_536" href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> Towards the end of the thirteenth century,
however, there were some sceptics in Italy who argued that
conviction by the duel ought not to entail the same punishment
as conviction by witnesses “quia pugna est incertum Dei
judicium.” This struck directly at the root of the whole system,
and Roffredo insists that the legal penalty is to be enforced.<a id="FNanchor_537_537" href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></p>

<p>Mediæval legislation was not usually lenient to a worsted
appellant. The application of the <i>lex talionis</i> to the man
who brought a false charge, thus adjudging to him the penalty
which was incurred by the defendant if convicted, was widely
current during the Middle Ages. This principle is to be found
enunciated in the broadest and most decided manner in the
ecclesiastical law,<a id="FNanchor_538_538" href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> and it was naturally brought into play in
regulating the fate of those engaged in the wager of battle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
Thus Guillaume le Breton states that when Philip Augustus,
in 1203, wrested Normandy from the feeble grasp of John
Lackland, one of the few changes which he ventured to introduce
in the local laws of the duchy was to substitute this rule
of confiscation, mutilation, or death, according to the degree
of criminality involved in the accusation, for the comparatively
light pecuniary mulct and loss of legal status previously incurred
by a worsted appellant.<a id="FNanchor_539_539" href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> The same system is followed
throughout the legislation of St. Louis, whether the punishment
be light or capital, of an equal responsibility on both
parties.<a id="FNanchor_540_540" href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> In capital cases, when champions were employed,
the principals were held in prison with the cord around them
with which the defeated party was to be hanged; and if one
were a woman, for the cord was substituted the spade wherewith
she was to be buried alive.<a id="FNanchor_541_541" href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> The same principle of equal
responsibility prevailed throughout the Frankish kingdoms of
the East, where, in an appeal of murder, as we have seen,
the appellant fought by means of one of his witnesses, and the
defendant personally. In civil cases, in the Bourgeois Court,
the party defeated, including the plaintiff, if his side was the
loser, was forever debarred from giving testimony, and had no
future standing in court; while in serious criminal cases, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
both upper and lower courts, either side, when defeated, was
hanged with the utmost impartiality;<a id="FNanchor_542_542" href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> and it finally established
itself in England, where in the fourteenth century we
find it positively declared as an imperative regulation by
Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, in an elaborate treatise on the
rules of single combat printed by Spelman.<a id="FNanchor_543_543" href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></p>

<p>In Germany the custom was not uniform. In the Sachsenspiegel,
and in one text of the Schwabenspiegel, the principle
is laid down that a defeated appellant escaped with a fine to
the judge and to his adversary, while the defendant, if
vanquished, was visited with the punishment due to his crime,
or even with a heavier penalty;<a id="FNanchor_544_544" href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> while the Saxon burgher law
and another text of the Suabian code direct that whichever
party be defeated should lose a hand, or be executed, according
to the gravity of the crime alleged.<a id="FNanchor_545_545" href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> An exceptional case,
moreover, was provided for, in which both antagonists might
suffer the penalty; thus, when a convicted thief accused a receiver
of stolen goods of having suggested the crime, the
latter was bound to defend himself by the duel, and if defeated,
both combatants were hanged without further ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_546_546" href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a>
That these penalties were not merely nominal is
shown by a case which occurred at Frankfort in 1369, when
the divine interference was requisite, not to determine the
victor, but to evade the enforcement of the law. Two knights,
Zierkin von Vola and Adolf Hanche, who had married two
sisters, quarrelled over the inheritance of a deceased brother-in-law,
and agreed to settle their difference by the duel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
When the appointed day came, October 12, they entered the
lists on their chargers, prepared to do battle to the death,
while their pious wives were earnestly praying God to soften
their hearts and incline them to peace. These prayers were
heard. With a mutual impulse the two warriors leaped
from their horses, throwing themselves into each other’s arms
and exclaiming, “Brother, I confess myself vanquished.”
The chief magistrate of the city, who presided over the combat,
was not disposed to deprive the spectators of their
promised entertainment, and indignantly declared that the
law of the duel did not permit both antagonists to depart unhurt,
for the one who yielded must be put to death; and he
confirmed this sentence by a solemn oath that one or the other
should die before he would taste food. Then an affecting
contest arose between the late antagonists, each one proclaiming
himself the vanquished and demanding the penalty on his
own head, when suddenly divine vengeance visited the bloody
and remorseless judge, who fell dead, thus fulfilling his impious
vow that he would not eat until he had a victim.<a id="FNanchor_547_547" href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></p>

<p>It was probably as an impressive symbol of the penalties
affixed by law to defeat in these combats that in some places
the suggestive custom was in force of placing in the lists two
biers in readiness for their ghastly occupants. In a duel
which occurred at Augsburg in 1409, between two men named
Marschalck and Hachsenacker, the former threw his adversary
on the ground, and then asked him what he would have done
had he been the victor. Hachsenacker grimly replied that he
would have slain his foe, whereupon Marschalck despatched
him, and placing himself in his bier caused himself to be carried
to the church of St. Ulric, where he returned thanks for
his victory.<a id="FNanchor_548_548" href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a></p>

<p>The most hideous exaggeration of the system, however, was
found in the Frankish kingdoms of the East, which reserved
a special atrocity for women—one of the numerous instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
to be observed in mediæval law of the injustice applied
habitually to the weaker sex. When a woman appeared,
either as appellant or defendant, in the lists by her champion,
if he was defeated she was promptly burnt, no matter what
was the crime for which the duel occurred—and as many
accusations could only be determined by the wager of battle,
she had no choice but to undergo the chance of the most
dreadful of deaths.<a id="FNanchor_549_549" href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></p>

<p>It was not customary to order the combat to take place immediately,
but to allow a certain interval for the parties to put
their affairs in order and to undergo the necessary training.
In Southern Germany this delay was for nobles from four to
six weeks, and for others a fortnight, and during this period
any assault by one on the other was a capital offence.<a id="FNanchor_550_550" href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> They
were required to give security for their due appearance at the
appointed time, various fines and punishments being inflicted
on defaulters. By the law of both Northern and Southern
Germany, when default was made by the defendant he was held
guilty of the crime charged upon him: and if he was allowed
the privilege of redeeming hand or life either as defendant or
appellant, he was declared infamous, and deprived of the protection
of the law. According to some MSS., indeed, all the
possessions of a defaulter were forfeited, either to his heirs or
to his feudal superior.<a id="FNanchor_551_551" href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> In a case occurring in the twelfth
century in Hainault, between a seigneur and a man whom he
claimed as a serf, the latter demanded the duel, which was
allowed, but on the appointed day he failed to appear by nine
o’clock. His adversary had waited for him since daybreak,
and claimed the verdict which was awarded him by the
council of Hainault. At this moment the missing man pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>sented
himself, but was adjudged to be too late, and was delivered
to his claimant as a serf. According to the custom of
Flanders, indeed, the combatant who failed to appear suffered
banishment, with confiscation of all his possessions.<a id="FNanchor_552_552" href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> This
extreme rigor, however, did not obtain universally. Among
the Béarnese, for instance, the forfeiture for a default was only
sixteen sous Morlaas.<a id="FNanchor_553_553" href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> By the English law, the defaulter was
declared infamous, and was also liable to a fine to the king,
for which there was apparently no fixed amount.<a id="FNanchor_554_554" href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> The Scandinavians
punished him popularly by erecting a “nithstong”—<i>pertica
execrationis</i>—a post inscribed with defamatory runes,
and so flagrant was this insult considered, that finally it was
prohibited by law under pain of exile.<a id="FNanchor_555_555" href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> Perhaps the most
emphatic assertion, however, of the obligation to appear is
the rule in the law of the Scottish Marches in 1249, that if
the accused should die before the appointed day his body
must be brought to the lists, “for no man can essoin himself
by death.”<a id="FNanchor_556_556" href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></p>

<p>The bail, of course, was liable for all legal penalties incurred
by a defaulter, and occasionally, indeed, was made to
share the fate of his principal, when the latter appeared and
was defeated. In the law of Southern Germany, according
to one text, the bail under these circumstances was liable to
the loss of a hand, which, however, he could redeem, while
another version makes him suffer the penalty incurred by his
principal.<a id="FNanchor_557_557" href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> This latter rule is announced in a miracle play of
the fourteenth century, where a stranger knight at the court of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Paris, compelled to fight in defence of the honor of the king’s
daughter, is unable to find security. The queen and princess
offer themselves as hostages and are accepted, but the king
warns them—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Dame, par Dieu le roy celestre!</div>
<div class="verse">Bien vous recevray pour hostage;</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">Et mettre en cendre.<a id="FNanchor_558_558" href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Poverty on the part of one of the combatants, rendering
him unable to equip himself properly for the combat, was not
allowed to interfere with the course of justice. In such cases,
under the law of Northern Germany, the judge was required
to provide him with the requisite weapons.<a id="FNanchor_559_559" href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> In England,
where the royal jurisdiction embraced all criminal cases, the
king furnished the weapons and paid all expenses, and when
the combatant was an “approver,” or criminal who had turned
state’s evidence, he was supported until his duty was accomplished
of fighting all whom he accused as accomplices.
Thus in the accounts of the sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1190,
there is an entry of 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for the approver Adam Godechap
from Pask until Michaelmas at one penny per diem; also 6<i>s.</i>
for his armor in three duels, and 38<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for carts to convey
prisoners, sureties, and probators from Lincoln to London and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_560_560" href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> The crown likewise paid the expenses of administering
the other ordeals: in 1166 a single entry in the
Exchequer accounts shows payment for thirty-four ordeals and
five battles.<a id="FNanchor_561_561" href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></p>

<p>As regards the choice of weapons, much curious anecdote
could be gathered from the pages of Brantôme and others
learned in punctilio, without throwing additional light upon
mediæval customs. It may be briefly observed, however,
that when champions were employed on both sides, the law
appears generally to have restricted them to the club and
buckler, and to have prescribed perfect equality between the
combatants.<a id="FNanchor_562_562" href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> An ordonnance of Philip Augustus, in 1215,
directs that the club shall not exceed three feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_563_563" href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>
In England the club or battoon was rendered more efficient
with a “crook,” usually of horn, but sometimes of iron, giving
to the weapon the truly formidable aspect of a pickaxe or
tomahawk.<a id="FNanchor_564_564" href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> When the principals appeared personally, it
would seem that in early times the appellant had the choice of
weapons, which not only gave him an enormous advantage,
but enabled him to indulge any whims which his taste or
fancy might suggest, as in the case of a Gascon knight in
the thirteenth century, who stipulated that each combatant
should be crowned with a wreath of roses. As every detail
of equipment was thus subject to the caprice of the challenger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
those who were wealthy sometimes forced their poorer adversaries
to lavish immense sums on horses and armor.<a id="FNanchor_565_565" href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> When,
however, the spirit of legislation became hostile to the wager
of battle, this advantage was taken from the appellant.
Frederic II. appears to have been the first to promulgate this
rational idea, and, in decreeing that in future the choice of
arms shall rest with the defendant, he stigmatizes the previous
custom as utterly iniquitous and unreasonable.<a id="FNanchor_566_566" href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> In this, as in
so many other matters, he was in advance of his age, and the
general rule was that neither antagonist should have any advantage
over the other, except the fearful inequality, to which
allusion has already been made, when a roturier dared to challenge
a gentleman.<a id="FNanchor_567_567" href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> In the law of Northern Germany care
was taken that the advantage of the sun was equally divided
between the combatants; they fought on foot, with bare heads
and feet, clad in tunics with sleeves reaching only to the elbow,
simple gloves, and no defensive armor except a wooden target
covered with hide, and bearing only an iron boss; each carried
a drawn sword, but either might have as many more as
he pleased in his belt.<a id="FNanchor_568_568" href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Even when nobles were concerned,
who fought on horseback, it was the rule that they should have
no defensive armor save a leather-covered wooden shield and
a glove to cover the thumb; the weapons allowed were lance,
sword, and dagger, and they fought bare-headed and clad in
linen tunics.<a id="FNanchor_569_569" href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> According to Upton, in the fifteenth century,
the judges were bound to see that the arms were equal, but he
admits that on many points there were no settled or definite
rules.<a id="FNanchor_570_570" href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> In Wales, an extraordinary custom violated all the
principles of equality. Under the Welsh law, twins were
considered as one person, and as they were entitled to but one
share in the patrimony of the family, so they were allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
come into the field of combat as one man.<a id="FNanchor_571_571" href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> In Russia, each
combatant followed his own pleasure; and a traveller in the
sixteenth century relates that the Muscovites were in the habit
of embarrassing themselves with defensive armor to an extent
which rendered them almost helpless, so that in combats with
Poles, Lithuanians, and Germans they were habitually worsted,
until judicial duels between natives and foreigners were at
length prohibited on this account.<a id="FNanchor_572_572" href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></p>

<p>As a general rule the combat ended at sunset or when the
stars became visible, and in such case if it was a drawn battle
the case was decided in favor of the defendant, because the
prosecutor had not proved his charge. Yet a charter of 961
recites that two gentlemen, Bernard and Gerbert, appeared
before Count Raymond, each claiming the church of St.
Médard and its appurtenances, which had been bequeathed by
the late owner Ricaud, for the repose of his soul, to the
Abbey of St. Peter of Beaulieu. The count granted them the
trial by battle. At two o’clock their champions entered the
lists and fought without result until sunset. Then the count
declared the battle ended and adjudged the church to the
abbey; the contestants acquiesced and signed the charter confirming
its rights.<a id="FNanchor_573_573" href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> In Italy, however, the duel was fought to
an end; if stopped by darkness the judge was instructed to
note carefully the respective positions of the combatants and
replace them exactly the next morning, so that neither might
derive advantage from the adjournment.<a id="FNanchor_574_574" href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></p>

<p>The issue at stake being death or dishonor, with severe
penalties hanging over the vanquished, whether principal or
champion, no chivalric courtesy was to be expected in these
combats. They were fought to the bitter end with persistent
and brutal ferocity, resembling the desperate encounters of
wild beasts. A fairly illustrative example is furnished in an inci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>dent
which followed the assassination of Charles the Good of
Flanders in 1127. One of the accomplices, a knight named
Guy, was challenged for complicity by another named Herman.
Both were renowned warriors, but Herman was speedily
unhorsed by his adversary, who with his lance frustrated all
his attempts to remount. Then Herman disabled the horse of
his opponent and the combat was renewed on foot with swords.
Equally skilful in fence they continued the struggle till fatigue
compelled them to drop sword and shield and they wrestled
for the mastery. Guy threw his antagonist, fell on him and
beat him in the face with his gauntlets till he seemed to be
motionless, but Herman quietly slipped his hand below the
other’s coat of mail, grasped his testicles and with a mighty
effort wrenched them away. Guy fell over and expired; he
we adjudged guilty and his body, after exposure in the pillory,
was hung on the top of a mast along with that of the leader
of the conspiracy who had been executed the same day, the
two corpses being made to embrace each other, as though conferring
about the plot.<a id="FNanchor_575_575" href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> Ghastly details such as these serve to
emphasize the difference between the judicial combat and the
modern duel.</p>

<small>CHAMPIONS.</small></h3>


<p>Allusions have occurred above to the employment of champions,
a peculiarity of these combats which received an application
sufficiently extended to deserve some special notice.<a id="FNanchor_576_576" href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
It has been seen that those unable to wield the sword or club
were not therefore exempted from the duel, and even the
scantiest measure of justice would require that they should
have the right to delegate their vindication to some more competent
vehicle of the Divine decision. This would seem
originally to have been the office of some member of the
family, as in the cognate procedure of sacramental purgation.
Among the Alamanni, for instance, a woman when accused
could be defended by a kinsman <i>cum tracta spata</i>;<a id="FNanchor_577_577" href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> the same
rule is prescribed by the Lombard law,<a id="FNanchor_578_578" href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> and by that of the
Angli and Werini;<a id="FNanchor_579_579" href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> while the universal principle of family
unity renders the presumption fair that it prevailed throughout
the other races in whose codes it is not specifically indicated.
Restricted to cases of disability, the use of champions was a
necessity to the battle ordeal; but at a very early period the
practice received a remarkable extension, which was directly
in conflict with the original principles of the judicial duel, in
permitting able-bodied antagonists to put forward substitutes,
whether connected with them or not by ties of blood, who
fought the battle for their principals. With regard to this
there appears to have been a considerable diversity of practice
among the races of primitive barbarians. The earliest
Frisian laws not only grant unlimited permission for their
employment, but even allow them to be hired for money.<a id="FNanchor_580_580" href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>
The laws of the Franks, of the Alamanni, and of the Saxons
make no allusion to such a privilege, and apparently expect
the principal to defend his rights himself, and yet an instance
occurs in 590, where, in a duel fought by order of Gontran,
the defendant was allowed to intrust his cause to his nephew,
though, as he was accused of killing a stag in the king’s forest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
physical infirmity could hardly have been pleaded.<a id="FNanchor_581_581" href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> From
some expressions made use of by St. Agobard, in his onslaught
on the ordeal of battle, we may fairly presume that, under
Louis le Débonnaire, the employment of champions, in the
Burgundian law, was, if not forbidden, at least unusual as
respects the defendant, even in cases where age or debility
unfitted him for the combat, while it was allowed as a matter
of course to the appellant.<a id="FNanchor_582_582" href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> On the other hand, the Baioarian
law, which favored the duel more than any of the other cognate
codes, alludes to the employment of champions in every
reference to it, and with the Lombards the judicial combat and
the champion seem to have been likewise convertible terms
even with regard to defendants.<a id="FNanchor_583_583" href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> In a charter of the latter
half of the tenth century in France, recording a judicial duel
to decide a contest concerning property, the judge, in ordering
the combat, calls upon the antagonists to produce skilled
champions to defend their claims at the time and place indicated,
which would show that the principals were not expected
to appear personally.<a id="FNanchor_584_584" href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> Under the North German law it rested
with the appellant to demand the duel either with or without
champions. If the defendant were crippled, and was on that
account obliged to appear by a hired champion, then the
appellant could put forward another to meet him. A defendant,
moreover, who had suffered a previous conviction for
theft or rapine was always obliged to appear personally.
When the duel was decreed by the court, and not demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
by the appellant, then the accused could decline it if he could
prove that the prosecutor had hired a champion.<a id="FNanchor_585_585" href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> The practical
spirit of the Italians led to the universal substitution of
champions for the principals; they were selected by the magistrates
and were paid by the state when the parties were too
poor to bear the expense.<a id="FNanchor_586_586" href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>In all these provisions for the putting forward of substitutes
in the duel there is something so repugnant to the fierce and
self-relying spirit in which the wager of battle found its origin,
and the use of a professional gladiator is so inconsistent with
the pious reference to the judgment of God, which was the
ostensible excuse for the duel, that some external reason is
required to account for its introduction. This reason is doubtless
to be found in the liberty allowed of challenging witnesses,
to which allusion has already been made (p. 121). The
prevalence of this throughout Western Europe readily enabled
parties, unwilling themselves to encounter the risks of a mortal
struggle, to put forward some truculent bravo who swore
unscrupulously, and whose evidence would require him to be
forced out of court at the sword’s point.</p>

<p>This becomes very evident as early as we have detailed
regulations of procedure in the books of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. In England, for instance, until the first
statute of Westminster, issued by Edward I., in 1275, the
hired champion of the defendant, in a suit concerning real
estate, was obliged to assume the position of a witness, by
swearing that he had been personally present and had seen
seizin given of the land, or that his father when dying had
enjoined him by his filial duty to maintain the defendan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>t’s
title as though he had been present.<a id="FNanchor_587_587" href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> This legal fiction was
common also to the Norman jurisprudence of the period,
where in such cases the champion of the plaintiff was obliged
to swear that he had heard and seen the matters alleged in
support of the claim, while the opposing champion swore that
they were false.<a id="FNanchor_588_588" href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> In a similar spirit, an earlier code of
Normandy prescribes that champions shall be taken to see the
lands and buildings in dispute, before receiving the oath of
battle, in the same manner as a jury of view.<a id="FNanchor_589_589" href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> We have seen
that in the Assises d’Antioche it was requisite for a prosecutor
or a plaintiff to have a witness who was ready to offer battle,
in default of which the unsupported oath of the other party
was sufficient to secure a verdict.<a id="FNanchor_590_590" href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> It necessarily follows that
this witness must in most cases have been a hired champion,
and this connection between the two functions is further
shown in the regulation of the Assises de Jerusalem and of the
Sicilian constitutions, which directed that the champion should
swear on the field of battle as to his belief in the justice of the
quarrel which he was about to defend,<a id="FNanchor_591_591" href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> a practice which is
also found in the Scottish law of the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_592_592" href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> An
English legal treatise of the period, indeed, assumes that the
principals can put forward only witnesses as substitutes, and
gives as a reason why combats in civil suits were always conducted
by champions, that in such cases the principals could
not act as witnesses for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_593_593" href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> In a similar spirit, if on
the field of battle one of the parties presented a champion who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
was not receivable as a witness and had not been accepted by
the court, the case could be decided against him by default.<a id="FNanchor_594_594" href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></p>

<p>Looking on the profession of a champion in this light, as
that of a witness swearing for hire, we can find a justification
for the heavy penalties to which he was subjected in case of
defeat—penalties of which the real purport presumably was to
insure his fidelity to his principal. Thus, in the Norman
coutumier above referred to, in civil suits as to disputed landed
possessions, the champion swearing to the truth of his principal’s
claim was, if defeated, visited with a heavy fine and was declared
infamous, being thenceforth incapable of appearing in
court either as plaintiff or as witness, while the penalty of the
principal was merely the loss of the property in dispute;<a id="FNanchor_595_595" href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> and
a similar principle was recognized in the English law of the
period.<a id="FNanchor_596_596" href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> In criminal cases, from a very early period, while
the principal perhaps escaped with fine or imprisonment, the
hired ruffian was hanged, or at best lost a hand or foot, the
immemorial punishment for perjury;<a id="FNanchor_597_597" href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> while the laws of the
Kingdom of Jerusalem prescribe that in combats between
champions, the defeated one shall be promptly hanged,
whether dead or alive.<a id="FNanchor_598_598" href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> The Assises d’Antioche are somewhat
more reasonable, for they provide merely that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
vanquished champion and his principal shall suffer the same
penalty, whether simply a forfeiture of civil rights in civil
cases, or hanging as in accusations of homicide or other
serious crime.<a id="FNanchor_599_599" href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> That, in the later periods, at least, the object
of this severity was to prevent the champion from betraying
his employer’s cause was freely admitted. Beaumanoir thus
defends it on the ground of the liability of champions to be
bought over by the adverse party, which rendered the gentle
stimulus of prospective mutilation necessary to prevent them
from being purchased by the adversary;<a id="FNanchor_600_600" href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> and it is probably
owing to this that the full severity of the punishment is shown
to be still in existence by a charter of so late a date as 1372,
when the use of the judicial duel had fully entered on its decline.<a id="FNanchor_601_601" href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a>
In the same spirit, the Emperor Frederic II. prohibited
champions from bargaining with each other not to use
teeth and hands. He commanded them to inflict all the
injury possible on their adversaries, and decreed that they
should, in case of defeat, share the punishment incurred by
the principal, if the judge of the combat should consider that
through cowardice or treachery they had not conducted the
duel with proper energy and perseverance.<a id="FNanchor_602_602" href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></p>

<p>With such risks to be encountered, it is no wonder that the
trade of the champion offered few attractions to honest men,
who could keep body and soul together in any other way.
In primitive times, the solidarity of the family no doubt
caused the champion in most cases to be drawn from among
the kindred; at a later period he might generally be procured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
from among the freedmen or clients of the principal, and an
expression in the Lombard law justifies the assumption that
this was habitual, among that race at least.<a id="FNanchor_603_603" href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> In the palmy
days of chivalry, it was perhaps not uncommon for the
generous knight to throw himself bodily into the lists in defence
of persecuted and friendless innocence, as he was bound
to do by the tenor of his oath of knighthood.<a id="FNanchor_604_604" href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Even as late
as the fifteenth century, indeed, in a collection of Welsh laws,
among the modes by which a stranger acquired the rights of
kindred is enumerated the act of voluntarily undergoing the
duel in the place of a principal unable or unwilling to appear
for himself.<a id="FNanchor_605_605" href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> A vast proportion of pleaders, however, would
necessarily be destitute of these chances to avoid the personal
appearance in the arena for which they might be unfitted or
disinclined, and thus there arose the regular profession of the
paid gladiator. Reckless desperadoes, skilled at quarter-staff,
or those whose familiarity with sword and dagger, gained by
a life spent in ceaseless brawls, gave them confidence in their
own ability, might undertake it as an occupation which exposed
them to little risk beyond what they habitually incurred,
and of such was the profession generally composed. This
evil must have made itself apparent early, for we find
Charlemagne endeavoring to oppose it by decreeing that no
robber should be allowed to appear in the lists as a champion,
and the order needed to be frequently repeated.<a id="FNanchor_606_606" href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>When the Roman law commenced to exercise its powerful
influence in moulding the feudal customs into a regular body
of procedure, and admiring jurists lost no opportunity of
making use of the newly-discovered treasures of legal lore,
whether applicable or not, it is easy to understand that the
contempt and the civil disabilities lavished by the Imperial
jurisprudence on the gladiator of antiquity came to be transferred
to the mediæval champion; although the latter, by the
theory of the law, stood forth to defend the innocent, while
the former ignobly exposed his life for the gratification of an
imbruted populace. This legacy of shame is clearly traceable
in Pierre de Fontaines. To be a gladiator or an actor was,
by the Roman law, a competent cause for disinheritance.<a id="FNanchor_607_607" href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a>
One of the texts prescribing it is translated bodily by de
Fontaines, the <i>arenarius</i> of the Roman becoming the <i>champions</i>
of the Frenchman;<a id="FNanchor_608_608" href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> and in another similar transcription from
the Digest, the <i>athleta</i> of the original is transformed into a
“champion.”<a id="FNanchor_609_609" href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> By the thirteenth century, the occupation of
champion had thus become infamous. Its professors were
classed with the vilest criminals, and with the unhappy females
who exposed their charms for sale, as the champion did his
skill and courage.<a id="FNanchor_610_610" href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> They were held incapable of appearing
as witnesses, and the extraordinary anomaly was exhibited of
seeking to learn the truth in affairs of the highest moment by
a solemn appeal to God, through the instrumentality of those
who were already considered as convicts of the worst kind, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
who, by the very act, were branded with infamy if successful
in justifying innocence, and if defeated were mutilated or
hanged.<a id="FNanchor_611_611" href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> By the codes in force throughout Germany in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, they were not only, in
common with bastards, actors, and jugglers, deprived of all
legal privileges, such as succeeding to property, bearing witness,
etc., but even their children were visited with the same
disabilities.<a id="FNanchor_612_612" href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> The utter contempt in which they were held
was moreover quaintly symbolized in the same codes by the
provisions of a tariff of damages to be assessed for blows and
other personal injuries. A graduated list of fines is given for
such insults offered to nobles, merchants, peasants, etc., in
compensation of their wounded honor; below the serf come
the mountebank and juggler, who could only cuff the assailant’s
shadow projected on the wall; and last of all are rated the
champion and his children, whose only redress was a glance
of sunshine cast upon them by the offender from a duelling
shield. Deemed by law incapable of receiving an insult, the
satisfaction awarded was as illusory as the honor to be repaired.<a id="FNanchor_613_613" href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a>
That this poetical justice was long in vogue is proved by the
commentary upon it in the Richstich Landrecht, of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
date is shown to be not earlier than the close of the fourteenth
century, by an allusion in the same chapter to accidental deaths
arising from the use of firearms.<a id="FNanchor_614_614" href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></p>

<p>The Italians, however, took a more sensible and practical
view of the matter. Accepting as a necessity the existence of
champions as a class, they were disposed rather to elevate
than to degrade the profession. The law required that they
should not be criminals or infamous, and the fact that they
fought for hire did not render them so.<a id="FNanchor_615_615" href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> In the Veronese code
of 1228, they appear as an established institution, consisting
of individuals selected and appointed by the magistrates, who
did not allow them to receive more than one hundred sous for
the performance of their office.<a id="FNanchor_616_616" href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the evils attendant upon the employment
of champions were generally recognized, and it is not singular
that efforts were occasionally made to abrogate or limit the
practice. Otho II., whose laws did so much to give respectability
to the duel, decreed that champions should be
permitted only to counts, ecclesiastics, women, boys, old men,
and cripples.<a id="FNanchor_617_617" href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> That this rule was strictly enforced in some
places we may infer from the pleadings of a case occurring in
1010 before the Bishop of Arezzo, concerning a disputed
property, wherein a crippled right hand is alleged as the reason
for allowing a champion to one of the parties.<a id="FNanchor_618_618" href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> In other
parts of Italy, however, the regulation must have been speedily
disregarded, for about the same period Henry II. found it
necessary to promulgate a law forbidding the employment of
substitutes to able-bodied defendants in cases of parricide or of
aggravated murder;<a id="FNanchor_619_619" href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> and when, two hundred years later,
Frederic II. almost abolished the judicial combat in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Neapolitan dominions, we may fairly presume from one of his
remarks that champions were universally employed.<a id="FNanchor_620_620" href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> Indeed,
he made provision for supplying them at the public expense
to widows, orphans, and paupers who might be unable to
secure for themselves such assistance.<a id="FNanchor_621_621" href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> In Germany, early in
the eleventh century, it would seem that champions were a
matter of course, from the expressions made use of in describing
the execution of a number of robbers convicted in this
manner at Merseburg in 1017.<a id="FNanchor_622_622" href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> At a later period, it seems
probable, from a comparison of two chapters of the Suabian
laws, that efforts were made to prevent the hiring of professional
gladiators,<a id="FNanchor_623_623" href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> and in the Saxon burgher laws a man could refuse
the duel if he could prove that his antagonist was a champion
serving for pay.<a id="FNanchor_624_624" href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> That these efforts to restrict the practice,
however, were attended with little success may be inferred
from the disabilities which were so copiously showered on the
class by the same laws.</p>

<p>In England, where, as we have seen, the identity of champions
and witnesses was clearly asserted, there were prolonged
efforts to suppress their hiring. In 1150, Henry II. strictly
prohibited the wager of battle with hired champions in his
Norman territories;<a id="FNanchor_625_625" href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> although the Norman custom not only
admitted them but required the principal to pay the full sum
agreed upon to his champion whether defeated or not.<a id="FNanchor_626_626" href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> We
learn from Glanville that a champion suspected of serving for
money might be objected to by the opposite party, whence
arose a secondary combat to determine his fitness for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
primary one.<a id="FNanchor_627_627" href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> Bracton, moreover, develops this by asserting
as a rule that a witness suspected of being a hired champion
was not allowed to proceed to the combat, but was tried for the
attempt by a jury, and if convicted suffered the penalty of
perjury in the loss of a hand or a foot,<a id="FNanchor_628_628" href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> and in another passage
he states that hired champions were not permitted.<a id="FNanchor_629_629" href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> How far
these rules were enforced it would now be difficult to determine.
Records show that a frequent defence against an adverse
witness was an offer to prove that he was a hired champion.<a id="FNanchor_630_630" href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a>
On the other hand, the payment of champions was
frequent and no concealment seems to have been thought
necessary concerning it. Towards the close of the twelfth
century, by a charter Stephen de Nerbana grants two <i>virgata</i>
of land to William son of Ralph “propter duellum quod fecit
pro me.”<a id="FNanchor_631_631" href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> In another charter of Bracton’s date John “quondam
porcarius de Coldingham” grants to the Priory of Coldingham
a tract of land which he had received from Adam de
Riston in payment for victoriously fighting a duel for him.<a id="FNanchor_632_632" href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Even more significant are the formal agreements with champions,
such as that by which in 1276 Bishop Swinefeld declares
to all men that he has appointed Thomas of Brydges his
champion, on a salary of 6s. 8d. per annum, so long as he
shall be able to fight, with extra compensation in case he is
called upon to perform his functions.<a id="FNanchor_633_633" href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> Eventually, as we have
seen (p. 183), in civil cases, both parties were compelled by
law to employ champions, which presupposes, as a matter of
course, that in a great majority of instances the substitutes
must have been hired.<a id="FNanchor_634_634" href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> In criminal cases there seems to have
been a compromise; in felonies, the defendant was obliged to
appear personally, while in accusations of less moment he was
at liberty to put forward a witness as champion;<a id="FNanchor_635_635" href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> and when
the appellant, from sex or other disability, or the defendant
from age, was unable to undergo the combat personally, it was
forbidden, and the case was decided by a jury.<a id="FNanchor_636_636" href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> By the Scottish
law of the thirteenth century, it is evident that champions
were not allowed in any case, since those disabled by age or
wounds were forced to undergo the ordeal in order to escape
the duel.<a id="FNanchor_637_637" href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> This strictness became relaxed in time, though the
practice of employing champions seems never to have received
much encouragement. By a law of Alexander II., about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
year 1250, it appears that a noble had the privilege of putting
forward a substitute; but if a peasant challenged a noble, he
was obliged to appear personally, unless his lord undertook
the quarrel for him and presented the champion as from
himself.<a id="FNanchor_638_638" href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></p>

<p>The tendency exhibited by the English law in distinguishing
between civil and criminal cases is also manifested elsewhere.
Thus, in France and the Frankish kingdoms of the East, there
were limitations placed by law on the employment of champions
in prosecutions for crime,<a id="FNanchor_639_639" href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> while in civil actions there
appear to have been, at least in France, no restrictions whatever.<a id="FNanchor_640_640" href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a>
This distinction between civil and criminal practice is
very clearly enunciated by Pierre de Fontaines, who states
that in appeal of judgment the appellant in criminal cases is
bound to show satisfactory cause for employing a champion,
while in civil affairs the right to do so requires no argument.<a id="FNanchor_641_641" href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a>
In practice, however, it is doubtful whether there was any
effectual bar to their use in any case, for the Monk of St. Denis,
in praising St. Louis for suppressing the battle-trial, gives as
one of the benefits of its abrogation, the removal of the abuse
by which a rich man could buy all the champions of the
vicinity, so that a poorer antagonist had no resource to avoid
the loss of life or heritage.<a id="FNanchor_642_642" href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> This hiring of champions, moreover,
was legally recognized as a necessity attendant upon the
privilege of employing them.<a id="FNanchor_643_643" href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> High rank, or a marked differ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>ence
between the station of parties to an action, was also admitted
as justifying the superior in putting forward a champion
in his place.<a id="FNanchor_644_644" href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> Local variations, however, are observable
in the customs regulating these matters. Thus the municipal
laws of Reims, in the fourteenth century, not only restrict
the admission of champions in criminal matters to cases in
which age or physical disability may incapacitate the principals
from personally taking part in the combat, but also require
the accused to swear that the impediment has supervened
since the date of the alleged offence; and even this was of
no avail if the prosecutor had included in his appeal of battle
an assertion that such disability had existed at the time specified.<a id="FNanchor_645_645" href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>
Witnesses obliged to support their testimony by the
duel were not only subject to the same restrictions, but in
substituting a hired gladiator were obliged to swear that they
had vainly sought among their friends for some one to assume
the office voluntarily.<a id="FNanchor_646_646" href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> The whole tenor of these provisions,
indeed, manifests a decided intention to surround the employment
of champions with every practicable impediment. In
Béarn, again, the appellant in cases of treason had a right to
decide whether the defendant should be allowed to put forward
a substitute, and from the expressions in the text it may
be inferred that in the selection of champions there was an
endeavor to secure equality of age, size, and strength.<a id="FNanchor_647_647" href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> This
equalization of chances was thoroughly carried out in Italy,
where the law required them to be selected with that view.<a id="FNanchor_648_648" href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Thus in the Veronese code of 1228, where, as has been seen,
the champions were a recognized body, regulated and controlled
by the state, no one could engage a champion before
a duel had been judicially decreed. Then the magistrate was
bound to choose gladiators of equal prowess, and the choice
between them was given to the defendant; an arrangement
which rendered the mutilation inflicted on the vanquished
combatant only justifiable on the score of suspected treachery.<a id="FNanchor_649_649" href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a>
A Bolognese regulation of the thirteenth century was
even fairer, and reduced the combat to an affair of chance in
which the judgment of God had the fullest scope, for when
the champions were in the lists a child placed inside of the
garments of each a card bearing the name of his principal, and
until the combat was ended no one knew which of them represented
the plaintiff and which the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_650_650" href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> In Bigorre, the
only restriction seems to have been that champions should be
natives and not foreigners, and their payment was recognized
as a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_651_651" href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> By the Spanish law of the thirteenth
century, the employment of champions was so restricted as to
show an evident desire on the part of the legislator to discourage
it as far as possible. The defendant had the right to
send a substitute into the field, but the appellant could do so
only by consent of his adversary. The champion was required
to be of birth equal to his principal, which rendered the hiring
of champions almost impossible, and not superior to him in
force and vigor. Women and minors appeared by their next
of kin, and ecclesiastics by their advocates.<a id="FNanchor_652_652" href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> In Russia, until
the sixteenth century, champions were never employed, contestants
being always obliged to appear in person. In 1550,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the code known as the Sudebtnick at length permitted the
employment of champions in certain cases.<a id="FNanchor_653_653" href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were two classes of pleaders, however, with whom
the hiring of champions was a necessity, and who could not
be bound by the limitations imposed on ordinary litigants.
While the sexagenary, the infant, and the crippled might
possibly find a representative among their kindred, and while
the woman might appear by her husband or next of kin, the
ecclesiastical foundations and chartered towns had no such
resource. Thus, in a suit for taxes, in 1164, before the court
of Verona, Bonuszeno of Soavo proved that the village of
Soavo had exempted his father Petrobatalla from all local
imposts for having served as champion in a duel between it
and a neighboring community, and his claim to the reversion
of the exemption was allowed.<a id="FNanchor_654_654" href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> So a charter of 1104 relates
how the monks of Noailles were harassed by the seizure of
some mills belonging to their abbey, claimed by an official of
William Duke of Aquitaine, until at length the duke agreed
to allow the matter to be decided by the duel, when the champion
of the church was victorious and the disputed property
was confirmed to the abbey.<a id="FNanchor_655_655" href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> At length the frequent necessity
for this species of service led to the employment of regularly
appointed champions, who fought the battles of their
principals for an annual stipend, or for some other advantages
bestowed in payment. Du Cange, for instance, gives the text
of an agreement by which one Geoffry Blondel, in 1256, bound
himself to the town of Beauvais as its champion for a yearly
salary of twenty sous Parisis, with extra gratifications of ten
livres Tournois every time that he appeared in arms to defend
its cause, fifty livres if blows were exchanged, and a hundred
livres if the combat were carried to a triumphant issue. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
a little singular that Beaumanoir, in digesting the customs of
Beauvais but a few years later, speaks of this practice as an
ancient and obsolete one, of which he had only heard through
tradition.<a id="FNanchor_656_656" href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> That it continued to be in vogue until long after,
is shown by Monteil, who alludes to several documents of the
kind, bearing date as late as the fifteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_657_657" href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></p>

<p>As a rule, ecclesiastical communities were likewise under
the necessity of employing champions to defend their rights.
Sometimes, as we have seen, these were hired, and were of no
better character than those of common pleaders. They seem
to have been well paid if we may judge from an agreement of
1258 between the Abbey of Glastonbury and Henry de
Fernbureg, by which the latter bound himself to defend by
battle the rights of the abbey to certain manors against the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, for which he is to receive thirty
sterling marks, of which ten are to be paid when battle is
gaged, five when he is shaved for the combat, and on the day
of the duel fifteen are to be placed in the hands of a third
party to be paid over to him if he strikes a single blow.<a id="FNanchor_658_658" href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>
Sometimes, however, gentlemen did not disdain to serve God
by fighting for the Church in special cases, as when, so late
as the middle of the fourteenth century, the priory of Tynemouth
had a suit with a troublesome neighbor, Gerard de
Widdrington, over the manor of Hawkshaw, and Sir Thomas
Colville, who had won great renown in the French wars, appeared
in court as its champion and offered the combat. No
one could be found hardy enough to accept his challenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and the manor was adjudged to the priory.<a id="FNanchor_659_659" href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> There was,
moreover, another class of champions of the Church who
occupied a distinguished position, and were bound to defend
the interests of their clients in the field as well as in the court
and in the lists; they also led the armed retainers of the
church when summoned by the suzerain to national war. The
office was honorable and lucrative, and was eagerly sought by
gentlemen of station, who turned to account the opportunities
of aggrandizement which it afforded; and many a noble
family traced its prosperity to the increase of ancestral property
thus obtained, directly or indirectly, by espousing the
cause of fat abbeys and wealthy bishoprics, as when, in the
ninth century, the Abbot of Figeac, near Cahors, bestowed
on a neighboring lord sixty churches and five hundred mansi
on condition of his fighting the battles of the abbey.<a id="FNanchor_660_660" href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> The
influence of feudalism early made itself felt, and the office of
<i>Vidame</i> or <i>Avoué</i> became generally hereditary, after which its
possessors, for the most part, rendered themselves independent
of their benefactors, their exactions and spoliations becoming
a favorite theme of objurgation among churchmen, who regarded
them as the worst enemies of the foundations which
they had sworn to protect.<a id="FNanchor_661_661" href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> In many instances the position
was a consideration obtained for donations bestowed upon
churches, so that in some countries, and particularly in England,
the title of <i>advocatus</i> became gradually recognized as
synonymous with patron. Thus, one of the worst abuses of
the Anglican Church is derived from this source, and the forgotten
wrongs of the Middle Ages are perpetuated, etymologically
at least, in the advowson which renders the cure of
souls too often a matter of bargain and sale.</p>

<small>DECLINE OF THE JUDICIAL COMBAT.</small></h3>


<p>So many influences were at work in favor of the judicial
duel, and it was so thoroughly engrafted in the convictions
and prejudices of Europe, that centuries were requisite for its
extirpation. Curiously enough, the earliest decisive action
against it took place in Iceland, where it was formally interdicted
as a judicial proceeding in 1011;<a id="FNanchor_662_662" href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> and though the
assumption that this was owing to the introduction of Christianity
has been disproved, still, the fact that both events
were contemporaneous allows us to conclude that some influence
may have been exercised by even so imperfect a
religion as that taught to the new converts, though the immediate
cause was a <i>holm-gang</i> between two skalds of distinction,
Gunnlaug Ormstunga and Skald-Rafn.<a id="FNanchor_663_663" href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> Norway
was not long in following the example, for about the same
period the Jarls Erik and Sven Hakonsen abolished the
<i>holm-gang</i>, while paganism was as yet widely prevalent.<a id="FNanchor_664_664" href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> Denmark
was almost equally prompt: indeed Saxo Grammaticus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
in one passage attributes to it the priority, asserting that when
Poppo, in 965, converted Harold Blaatand by the ordeal of
red-hot iron, it produced so powerful an effect as to induce
the substitution of that mode of trial for the previously existing
wager of battle.<a id="FNanchor_665_665" href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> Yet it evidently was not abolished for a
century later, for when Harold the Simple, son of Sven
Estrith, ascended the throne in 1074, among the legal innovations
which he introduced was the substitution of the purgatorial
oath for all other forms of defence, which, as Saxo specifically
states, put an end to the wager of battle, and opened the door
to great abuses.<a id="FNanchor_666_666" href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a></p>

<p>Fiercer tribes than these in Europe there were none, and
their abrogation of the battle trial at this early age is an inexplicable
anomaly. It was an exceptional movement, however,
without results beyond their own narrow boundaries.
Other causes had to work slowly and painfully for ages before
man could throw off the bonds of ancestral prejudice. One
of the most powerful of these causes was the gradual rise of
the Tiers-État to consideration and importance. The sturdy
bourgeois, though ready enough with morion and pike to defend
their privileges, were usually addicted to a more peaceful
mode of settling private quarrels. Devoted to the arts of
peace, seeing their interest in the pursuits of industry and
commerce, enjoying the advantage of settled and permanent
tribunals, and exposed to all the humanizing and civilizing influences
of close association in communities, they speedily
acquired ideas of progress very different from those of the
savage feudal nobles living isolated in their fastnesses, or of
the wretched serfs who crouched for protection around the
castles of their masters. Accordingly, the desire to escape
from the necessity of purgation by battle is almost coeval with
the founding of the first communes. The earliest instance of
this tendency that I have met with is contained in the charter
granted to Pisa by the Emperor Henry IV. in 1081, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
he agrees that any accusations which he may bring against
citizens can be tried without battle by the oaths of twelve
compurgators, except when the penalties of death or mutilation
are involved; and in questions concerning land, the duel is
forbidden when competent testimony can be procured.<a id="FNanchor_667_667" href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> Limited
as these concessions may seem, they were an immense innovation
on the prejudices of the age, and are important as affording
the earliest indication of the direction which the new
civilization was assuming. More comprehensive was the
privilege granted soon afterwards by Henry I. to the citizens
of London, by which he released them wholly from the duel,
and this was followed by similar exemptions during the twelfth
century bestowed on one town after another; but it was not
till near the end of the century that in Scotland William the
Lion granted the first charter of this kind to Inverness.<a id="FNanchor_668_668" href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a>
About the year 1105, the citizens of Amiens received a charter
from their bishop, St. Godfrey, in which the duel is subjected
to some restriction—not enough in itself, perhaps, to effect
much reform, yet clearly showing the tendency which existed.
According to the terms of this charter no duel could be decreed
concerning any agreement entered into before two or
three magistrates if they could bear witness to its terms.<a id="FNanchor_669_669" href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a>
One of the earliest instances of absolute freedom from the
judicial combat occurs in a charter granted to the town of
Ypres, in 1116 by Baldwin VII. of Flanders, when he substituted
the oath with four conjurators in all cases where the
duel or the ordeal was previously in use.<a id="FNanchor_670_670" href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> This was followed
by a similar grant to the inhabitants of Bari by Roger, King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
of Naples, in 1132.<a id="FNanchor_671_671" href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> Curiously enough, almost contemporary
with this is a similar exemption bestowed on the rude mountaineers
of the Pyrenees. Centulla I. of Bigorre, who died in
1138, in the Privileges of Lourdes, authorizes the inhabitants
to prosecute their claims without the duel;<a id="FNanchor_672_672" href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> and his desire to
discourage the custom is further shown by a clause permitting
the pleader who has gaged his battle to withdraw on payment
of a fine of only five sous to the seigneur, in addition to what
the authorities of the town may levy.<a id="FNanchor_673_673" href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> Still more decided
was a provision of the laws of Soest in Westphalia, somewhat
earlier than this, by which the citizens were absolutely prohibited
from appealing each other in battle;<a id="FNanchor_674_674" href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> and this is also
to be found in a charter granted to the town of Tournay by
Philip Augustus in 1187, though in the latter the cold water
ordeal is prescribed for cases of murder and of wounding by
night.<a id="FNanchor_675_675" href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> In the laws of Ghent, granted by Philip of Alsace in
1178, there is no allusion to any species of ordeal, and all
proceedings seem to be based on the ordinary processes of law,
while in the charter of Nieuport, bestowed by the same prince
in 1163, although the ordeal of red-hot iron and compurgatorial
oaths are freely alluded to as means of rebutting accusations,
there is no reference whatever to the battle trial, showing that
it must then have been no longer in use.<a id="FNanchor_676_676" href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> The charters
granted to Medina de Pomar in 1219 by Fernando III. of
Castile, and to Treviño by Alfonso X. in 1254, provide that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
there shall be no trial by single combat.<a id="FNanchor_677_677" href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> Louis VIII. in the
charter of Crespy, granted in 1223, promised that neither
himself nor his officials should in future have the right to demand
the wager of battle from its inhabitants;<a id="FNanchor_678_678" href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> and shortly
after, the laws of Arques, conceded by the abbey of St. Bertin
in 1231, provided that the duel could only be decreed between
two citizens of that commune when both parties should assent
to it.<a id="FNanchor_679_679" href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> In the same spirit the laws of Riom, granted by
Alphonse de Poitiers, the son of St. Louis, in 1270, declared
that no inhabitant of the town should be forced to submit to
the wager of battle.<a id="FNanchor_680_680" href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> In the customs of Maubourguet, granted
in 1309, by Bernard VI. of Armagnac, privileges similar to
those of Lourdes, alluded to above, were included, rendering
the duel a purely voluntary matter.<a id="FNanchor_681_681" href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> Even in Scotland, partial
exemptions of the same kind in favor of towns are found as
early as the twelfth century. A stranger could not force a
burgher to fight, except on an accusation of treachery or theft,
while, if a burgher desired to compel a stranger to the duel,
he was obliged to go beyond the confines of the town. A
special privilege was granted to the royal burghs, for their
citizens could not be challenged by the burghers of nobles or
prelates, while they had the right to offer battle to the latter.<a id="FNanchor_682_682" href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>
Much more efficient was the clause of the third <i>Keure</i> of
Bruges, granted in 1304 by Philip son of Count Guy of
Flanders, which strictly prohibited the duel. Any one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
gave or received a wager of battle was fined sixty sols, one-half
for the benefit of the town, and the other for the count.<a id="FNanchor_683_683" href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></p>

<p>The special influence exercised by the practical spirit of trade
in rendering the duel obsolete is well illustrated by the privilege
granted, in 1127, by William Clito, to the merchants of
St. Omer, declaring that they should be free from all appeals
to single combat in all the markets of Flanders.<a id="FNanchor_684_684" href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> In a similar
spirit, when Frederic Barbarossa, in 1173, was desirous of attracting
to the markets of Aix-la-Chapelle and Duisbourg the
traders of Flanders, in the code which he established for the
protection of such as might come, he specially enacted that
they should enjoy immunity from the duel.<a id="FNanchor_685_685" href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> Even Russia
found it advantageous to extend the same exemption to foreign
merchants, and in the treaty which Mstislas Davidovich
made in 1228 with the Hanse-town of Riga, he granted to the
Germans who might seek his dominions immunity from liability
to the red-hot iron ordeal and wager of battle.<a id="FNanchor_686_686" href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<p>Germany seems to have been somewhat later than France
or Italy in the movement, yet her burghers evidently regarded
it with favor. Frederic II., who recorded his disapproval of
the duel in his Sicilian Constitutions, was ready to encourage
them in this tendency, and in his charters to Ratisbon and
Vienna he authorized their citizens to decline the duel and
clear themselves by compurgation,<a id="FNanchor_687_687" href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> while as early as 1219 he
exempted the Nürnbergers from the appeal of battle throughout
the empire.<a id="FNanchor_688_688" href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> The burgher law of Northern Germany
alludes to the judicial combat only in criminal charges, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
as violence, homicide, housebreaking, and theft;<a id="FNanchor_689_689" href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> and this is
limited in the statutes of Eisenach, of 1283, which provide
that no duel shall be adjudged in the town, except in cases of
homicide, and then only when the hand of the murdered man
shall be produced in court at the trial.<a id="FNanchor_690_690" href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> In 1291, Rodolph
of Hapsburg issued a constitution declaring that the burghers
of the free imperial cities should not be liable to the duel outside
of the limits of their individual towns,<a id="FNanchor_691_691" href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> and in the Kayser-Recht
this privilege is extended by declaring the burghers
exempt from all challenge to combat, except in a suit brought
by a fellow-citizen.<a id="FNanchor_692_692" href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> Notwithstanding this, special immunities
continued to be granted, showing that these general laws
were of little effect unless supported by the temper of the
people. Thus Louis IV. in 1332 gave such a privilege to
Dortmund, and so late as 1355 Charles IV. bestowed it on
the citizens of Worms.<a id="FNanchor_693_693" href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></p>

<p>A somewhat noteworthy exception to this tendency on the
part of the municipalities is to be found in Moravia. There,
under the laws of Ottokar Premizlas, in 1229 the duel was forbidden
between natives and only allowed when one of the parties
was a foreigner. Yet his son Wenceslas, some years later,
confirmed the customs of the town of Iglau, in which the duel
was a recognized feature enforced by an ascending scale of
fines. If the accused compounded with the prosecutor before
the duel was ordered he paid the judge one mark; after it was
adjudged, two marks; after the lists were entered, three marks;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
after weapons were taken, four marks; and if he waited till the
weapons were drawn he had to pay five marks.<a id="FNanchor_694_694" href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All these were local regulations which had no direct bearing
on general legislation, except in so far as they might assist in
softening the manners of their generation and aiding in the
general spread of civilization. A more efficient cause was to
be found in the opposition of the Church. From Liutprand
the Lombard to Frederic II., a period of five centuries, no
secular lawgiver, south of Denmark, seems to have thought of
abolishing the judicial combat as a measure of general policy,
and those whose influence was largest were the most conspicuous
in fostering it. During the whole of this period the Church
was consistently engaged in discrediting it, notwithstanding
that the local interests or pride of individual prelates might
lead them to defend the vested privileges connected with it in
their jurisdictions.</p>

<p>When King Gundobald gave form and shape to the battle
ordeal in digesting the Burgundian laws, Avitus, Bishop of
Vienne, remonstrated loudly against the practice as unjust and
unchristian. A new controversy arose on the occasion of the
duel between the Counts Bera and Sanila, to which allusion
has already been made as one of the important events in the
reign of Louis le Débonnaire. St. Agobard, Archbishop of
Lyons, took advantage of the opportunity to address to the
Emperor a treatise in which he strongly deprecated the settlement
of judicial questions by the sword; and he subsequently
wrote another tract against ordeals in general, consisting principally
of scriptural texts with a running commentary, proving
the incompatibility of Christian doctrines with these unchristian
practices.<a id="FNanchor_695_695" href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> Some thirty-five years later the Council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Valence, in 855, denounced the wager of battle in the most
decided terms, praying the Emperor Lothair to abolish it
throughout his dominions, and adopting a canon which not
only excommunicated the victor in such contests, but refused
the rights of Christian sepulture to the victim.<a id="FNanchor_696_696" href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> By this time
the forces of the church were becoming consolidated in the
papacy, and the Vicegerent of God was beginning to make
his voice heard authoritatively throughout Europe. The popes
accordingly were not long in protesting energetically against
the custom. Nicholas I. denounced it vigorously as a tempting
of God, unauthorized by divine law,<a id="FNanchor_697_697" href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> and his successors
consistently endeavored, as we have already seen, to discredit
it. In the latter half of the twelfth century, Peter Cantor argues
that a champion undertaking the combat relies either on
his superior strength and skill, which is manifest injustice; or
on the justice of his cause, which is presumption; or on a special
miracle, which is a devilish tempting of God.<a id="FNanchor_698_698" href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> Alexander
III. decided that a cleric engaging in a duel, whether willingly
or unwillingly, whether victor or vanquished, was subject to
deposition, but that his bishop could grant him a dispensation
provided there had been loss of neither life nor limb.<a id="FNanchor_699_699" href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> Towards
the close of the century Celestine III. went further, and in the
case of a priest who had put forward a champion who had slain
his antagonist he decided that both principal and champion
were guilty of homicide and the priest could no longer perform
his functions, though he might have a dispensation to hold his
benefice.<a id="FNanchor_700_700" href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> These cases suggest one of the reasons why the repeated
papal prohibitions were so ineffective. The all-pervading
venality of the Church of the period found in the dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>pensing
power an exhaustless source of profit, and dispensations
for “irregularities” of all kinds were so habitually issued that
the threatened punishments lost their terrors, and as Rome
gradually absorbed the episcopal jurisdiction, offenders of all
kinds knew that relief from the operation of the canons could
always be had there. Some reason for setting them aside was
never hard to find. In 1208 a canon of Bourges was elected
prior; his disappointed competitor claimed that he was ineligible
because he had once served as judge in a duel in which
there was effusion of blood. Innocent III. was appealed to,
who decided that the canon was capable of promotion to any
dignity, and the chief reason alleged was that the evil custom
of the duel was so universal in some regions that ecclesiastics
of all classes from the lowest to the highest were habitually
concerned in them.<a id="FNanchor_701_701" href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></p>

<p>Innocent III., however, took care that the great council of
Lateran in 1215 should confirm all the previous prohibitions of
the practice.<a id="FNanchor_702_702" href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> It was probably this papal influence that led
Simon de Montfort, the special champion of the church, to
limit the use of the duel in the territories which he won in his
crusade against the Count of Toulouse. In a charter given
December 1, 1212, he forbids its use in all the seignorial courts
in his dominions, except in cases of treason, theft, robbery,
and murder.<a id="FNanchor_703_703" href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> De Montfort’s dependence on Rome, however,
was exceptional, and Christendom at large was not as yet prepared
to appreciate the reformatory efforts of the popes. The
most that the Council of Paris, held in 1212 for the reformation
of the church by the cardinal-legate Robert de Curzon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
could do was to order the bishops not to permit the duel in
cemeteries or other sacred places.<a id="FNanchor_704_704" href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></p>

<p>The opposition of the church as represented by its worthiest
and most authoritative spokesmen continued. St. Ramon de
Peñafort, the leading canonist of his time, about 1240, asserts
uncompromisingly that all concerned in judicial combats are
guilty of mortal sin; the sin is somewhat lightened indeed
when the pleader is obliged to accept the combat by order of
the judge, but the judge himself, the assessors who counsel it,
and the priest who gives the benediction all sin most gravely;
if death occurs they are all homicides and are rendered “irregular.”<a id="FNanchor_705_705" href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a>
About the same time Alexander Hales ingeniously
argued away the precedent of David and Goliath by showing
that it was simply a prefiguration of the Passion, in which
Christ triumphed over Satan as in a duel.<a id="FNanchor_706_706" href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> With the development,
moreover, of the subtilties of scholastic theology the
doctors found that the duel was less objectionable than the
other forms of ordeal, because, as Thomas Aquinas remarks,
the hot iron or boiling water is a direct tempting of God, while
the duel is only a matter of chance, for no one expects miraculous
interposition unless the champions are very unequal in
age or strength.<a id="FNanchor_707_707" href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> This struck at the very root of the faith
on which confidence in the battle ordeal was based, yet in
spite of it the persistence of ecclesiastical belief in the divine
interposition is fairly illustrated by a case, related with great
triumph by monkish chroniclers, as late as the fourteenth century,
when a duel was undertaken by direction of the Virgin
Mary herself. In 1325, according to the story, a French Jew
feigned conversion to Christianity in order to gratify his spleen
by mutilating the images in the churches, and at length he
committed the sacrilege of carrying off the holy wafer to aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
in the hideous rites of his fellows. The patience of the Virgin
being at last exhausted, she appeared in a vision to a certain
smith, commanding him to summon the impious Israelite to
the field. A second and a third time was the vision repeated
without effect, till at last the smith, on entering a church, was
confronted by the Virgin in person, scolded for his remissness,
promised an easy victory, and forbidden to pass the church
door until his duty should be accomplished. He obeyed and
sought the authorities. The duel was decreed, and the unhappy
Hebrew, on being brought into the lists, yielded without
a blow, falling on his knees, confessing his unpardonable
sins, and crying that he could not resist the thousands of armed
men who appeared around his adversary with threatening
weapons. He was accordingly promptly burned, to the great
satisfaction of all believers.<a id="FNanchor_708_708" href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></p>

<p>Evidently the clergy at large did not second the reformatory
efforts of their pontiffs. There was not only the ancestral
belief implanted in the minds of those from among whom they
were drawn, but the seignorial rights enjoyed by prelates and
abbeys were not to be willingly abandoned. The progress of
enlightenment was slow and the teachings of the papacy can only
be enumerated as one of the factors at work to discredit the
judicial duel.<a id="FNanchor_709_709" href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> We can estimate how deeply rooted were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
prejudices to be overcome when we find Dante seriously arguing
that property acquired by the duel is justly acquired; that
God may be relied upon to render the just cause triumphant;
that it is wicked to doubt it, while it is folly to believe that a
champion can be the weaker when God strengthens him.<a id="FNanchor_710_710" href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></p>

<p>In its endeavors to suppress the judicial duel the Church had
to weigh opposing difficulties. It could, as we have seen (p.
156), enjoin its members from taking part in such combats and
from adjudging them in their jurisdictions; it could decree
that priests became “irregular” if death ensued in duels where
they gave the benediction, or perhaps even where they had
only brought relics on which the combatants took the oaths.
But over the secular courts it had only the power of persuasion,
or at most of moral coercion, and among the canon doctors
there was considerable discussion as to the extent to which it
could pronounce participation in the duel a mortal sin, entailing
excommunication and denial of the rites of sepulture.
When a man sought the duel, when he demanded it of the
judge and provoked his adversary to it, he could be pronounced
guilty of homicide if death ensued. It was otherwise where
an innocent man was accused of a mortal crime and would be
hanged if he refused the duel adjudged to him by court. It
was argued that the Church was a harsh mother if she forced
her children thus to submit to death and infamy for a scruple
of recent origin, raised merely by papal command, though
the more rigid casuists insisted even on this. All agreed, however,
that in civil cases a man ought rather to undergo the loss of
his property than to imperil his soul and disobey the Church.<a id="FNanchor_711_711" href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the most powerful cause at work was the revival of
the Roman jurisprudence, which in the thirteenth century com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>menced
to undermine all the institutions of feudalism. Its
theory of royal supremacy was most agreeable to sovereigns
whose authority over powerful vassals was scarcely more than
nominal; its perfection of equity between man and man could
not fail to render it enticing to clear-minded jurists, wearied
with the complicated and fantastic privileges of ecclesiastical,
feudal, and customary law. Thus recommended, its progress
was rapid. Monarchs lost no opportunity of inculcating respect
for that which served their purpose so well, and the civil
lawyers, who were their most useful instruments, speedily rose
to be a power in the state. Of course the struggle was long,
for feudalism had arisen from the necessities of the age, and
a system on which were based all the existing institutions of
Europe could only be attacked in detail, and could only be
destroyed when the advance of civilization and the general
diffusion of enlightenment had finally rendered it obsolete.
The French Revolution was the final battle-field, and that
terrible upheaval was requisite to obliterate a form of society
whose existence had numbered nine hundred years.</p>

<p>The wager of battle was not long in experiencing the first
assaults of the new power. The earliest efficient steps towards
its abolition were taken in 1231 by the Emperor Frederic II.
in his Neapolitan code. He pronounces it to be in no sense a
legal proof, but only a species of divination, incompatible with
every notion of equity and justice; and he prohibits it for the
future, except in cases of poisoning or secret murder and
treason where other proof is unattainable; and even in these
it is placed at the option of the accuser alone; moreover, if
the accuser commences by offering proof and fails he cannot
then have recourse to combat; the accused must be acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_712_712" href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a>
The German Imperial code, known as the Kayser-Recht, which
was probably compiled about the same time, contains a similar
denunciation of the uncertainty of the duel, but does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
venture on a prohibition, merely renouncing all responsibility
for it, while recognizing it as a settled custom.<a id="FNanchor_713_713" href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> In the portion,
however, devoted to municipal law, which is probably
somewhat later in date, the prohibition is much more stringently
expressed, manifesting the influences at work;<a id="FNanchor_714_714" href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> but even
this is contradicted by a passage almost immediately preceding
it. How little influence these wise counsels had, in a state so
intensely feudal and aristocratic, is exemplified in the Suabian
and Saxon codes, where the duel plays so important a part.
Yet the desire to escape it was not altogether confined to the
honest burghers of the cities, for in 1277 Rodolph of Hapsburg,
even before he granted immunity to the imperial towns,
gave a charter to the duchy of Styria, securing to the Styrians
their privileges and rights, and in this he forbade the duel in
all cases where sufficient testimony could be otherwise obtained;
while the general tenor of the document shows that this was
regarded as a favor.<a id="FNanchor_715_715" href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> The Emperor Albert I. was no less
desirous of restricting the duel, and in ordinary criminal cases
endeavored to substitute compurgation.<a id="FNanchor_716_716" href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a></p>

<p>Still, as late as 1487, the Inquisitor Sprenger, in discountenancing
the red-hot iron ordeal in witch-trials, feels himself
obliged to meet the arguments of those who urged the
lawfulness of the duel as a reason for permitting the cognate
appeal to the ordeal. To this he naïvely replies, as Thomas
Aquinas had done, that they are essentially different, as the
champions in a duel are about equally matched, and the killing
of one of them is a simple affair, while the iron ordeal,
or that of drinking boiling water, is a tempting of God by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
requiring a miracle.<a id="FNanchor_717_717" href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> This shows at the same time how thoroughly
the judicial combat had degenerated from its original
theory, and that the appeal to the God of battles had become
a mere question of chance, or of the comparative strength
and skill of a couple of professional bravos.</p>

<p>In Spain the influence of Roman institutions, transmitted
through the Wisigothic laws, had allowed to the judicial duel
less foothold than in other mediæval lands, and the process of
suppressing it began early. In Aragon the chivalrous Jayme
I., <i>el Conquistador</i>, in the franchises granted to Majorca,
on its conquest in 1230, prohibited the judicial combat in both
civil and criminal cases.<a id="FNanchor_718_718" href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> Within forty years from this,
Alfonso the Wise of Castile issued the code generally known
as Las Siete Partidas. In this he evidently desired to curb
the practice as far as possible, stigmatizing it as a custom
peculiar to the military class (<i>por lid de caballeros ò de
peones</i>), and as reprehensible both as a tempting of God and
as a source of perpetual injustice.<a id="FNanchor_719_719" href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> Accordingly, he subjected
it to very important limitations. The wager of battle could
only be granted by the king himself; it could only take place
between gentlemen, and in personal actions alone which savored
of treachery, such as murder, blows, or other dishonor, inflicted
without warning or by surprise. Offences committed against
property, burning, forcible seizure, and other wrongs, even
without defiance, were specifically declared not subject to its
decision, the body of the plaintiff being its only recognized
justification.<a id="FNanchor_720_720" href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> Even in this limited sphere, the consent of both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
parties was requisite, for the appellant could prosecute in the
ordinary legal manner, and the defendant, if challenged to
battle, could elect to have the case tried by witnesses or inquest,
nor could the king himself refuse him the right to do
so.<a id="FNanchor_721_721" href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> When to this is added that a preliminary trial was requisite
to decide whether the alleged offence was treacherous in
its character or not, it will be seen that the combat was hedged
around with such difficulties as rendered its presence on the
statute book scarcely more than an unmeaning concession to
popular prejudice; and if anything were wanting to prove the
utter contempt of the legislator for the decisions of the battle-trial,
it is to be found in the regulation that if the accused was
killed on the field, without confessing the imputed crime, he
was to be pronounced innocent, as one who had fallen in vindicating
the truth.<a id="FNanchor_722_722" href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> The same desire to restrict the duel
within the narrowest possible limits is shown in the rules concerning
the employment of champions, which have been already
alluded to. Although the Partidas as a scheme of legislation
was not confirmed until the cortes of 1348 these provisions
were lasting and produced the effect designed. It is true that
in 1342 we hear of a combat ordered by Alfonso XI. between
Pay Rodriguez de Ambia and Ruy Paez de Biedma, who
mutually accused each other of treason. It was fought before
the king and lasted for three days without either party obtaining
the victory, till, on the evening of the third day, the king
entered the lists and pacified the quarrel, saying that both
antagonists could serve him better by fighting the Moors, with
whom he was at war, than by killing each other.<a id="FNanchor_723_723" href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> Not long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
afterwards Alfonso in the Ordenamiento de Alcalá, issued in
1348, repeated the restrictions of the Partidas, but in a very
cursory manner, and rather incidently than directly, showing
that the judicial combat was then a matter of little importance.<a id="FNanchor_724_724" href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a>
In fact, the jurisprudence of Spain was derived so directly
from the Roman law through the Wisigothic code and its
Romance recension, the Fuero Juzgo, that the wager of battle
could never have become so deeply rooted in the national faith
as among the more purely barbarian races. It was therefore
more readily eradicated, and yet, as late as the sixteenth century,
a case occurred in which the judicial duel was prescribed
by Charles V., in whose presence the combat took place.<a id="FNanchor_725_725" href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></p>

<p>The varying phases of the struggle between progress and
centralization on the one side, and chivalry and feudalism on
the other, were exceedingly well marked in France, and as the
materials for tracing them are abundant, a more detailed account
of the gradual reform may perhaps have interest, as illustrating
the long and painful strife which has been necessary to
evoke order and civilization out of the incongruous elements
from which modern European society has sprung. The sagacity
of St. Louis, so rarely at fault in the details of civil administration,
saw in the duel not only an unchristian and unrighteous
practice, but a symbol of the disorganizing feudalism
which he so energetically labored to suppress. His temper
led him rather to adopt pacific measures, in sapping by the
forms of law the foundations of the feudal power, than to
break it down by force of arms as his predecessors had attempted.
The centralization of the Roman polity might well
appear to him and his advisers the ideal of a well-ordered
state, and the royal supremacy had by this time advanced to
a point where the gradual extension of the judicial prerogatives
of the crown might prove the surest mode of humbling
eventually the haughty vassals who had so often bearded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
sovereign. No legal procedure was more closely connected
with feudalism, or embodied its spirit more thoroughly, than
the wager of battle, and Louis accordingly did all that lay in
his power to abrogate the custom. The royal authority was
strictly circumscribed, however, and though, in his celebrated
Ordonnance of 1260, he formally prohibited the battle trial in
the territory subject to his jurisdiction,<a id="FNanchor_726_726" href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> he was obliged to admit
that he had no power to control the courts of his barons
beyond the domains of the crown.<a id="FNanchor_727_727" href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> Even within this comparatively
limited sphere, we may fairly assume from some
passages in the Établissements, compiled about the year 1270,
that he was unable to do away entirely with the practice. It
is to be found permitted in some cases both civil and criminal,
of peculiarly knotty character, admitting of no other apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
solution.<a id="FNanchor_728_728" href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> It seems, indeed, remarkable that he should even
have authorized personal combat between brothers, in criminal
accusations, only restricting them in civil suits to fighting by
champions,<a id="FNanchor_729_729" href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> when the German law of nearly the same period
forbids the duel, like marriage, between relations in the fifth
degree, and states that previously it had been prohibited to
those connected in the seventh degree.<a id="FNanchor_730_730" href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a></p>

<p>Even this qualified reform provoked determined opposition.
Every motive of pride and interest prompted resistance. The
prejudices of birth, the strength of the feudal principle, the
force of chivalric superstition, the pride of self-reliance gave
keener edge to the apprehension of losing an assured source
of revenue. The right of granting the wager of battle was
one of those appertaining to the <i>hauts-justiciers</i>, and so highly
was it esteemed that paintings of champions fighting frequently
adorned their halls as emblems of their prerogatives; Loysel,
indeed, deduces from it a maxim, “The pillory, the gibbet,
the iron collar, and paintings of champions engaged, are marks
of high jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_731_731" href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> This right had a considerable money
value, for the seigneur at whose court an appeal of battle was
tried received from the defeated party a fine of sixty livres if
he was a gentleman, and sixty sous if a roturier, besides a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
perquisite of the horses and arms employed, and heavy mulcts
for any delays which might be asked,<a id="FNanchor_732_732" href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> besides fines from those
who withdrew after the combat was decreed.<a id="FNanchor_733_733" href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> Nor was this
all, for during the centuries of its existence there had grown
and clustered around the custom an immeasurable mass of
rights and privileges which struggled lustily against destruction.
Thus, hardly had the ordonnance of prohibition been issued
when, in 1260, a knight named Mathieu le Voyer actually
brought suit against the king for the loss it inflicted upon him.
He dolefully set forth that he enjoyed the privilege of guarding
the lists in all duels adjudged in the royal court at Corbon,
for which he was entitled to receive a fee of five sous in each
case; and, as his occupation thus was gone, he claimed compensation,
modestly suggesting that he be allowed the same
tax on all inquests held under the new law.<a id="FNanchor_734_734" href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> How closely all
such sources of revenue were watched is illustrated by a case
occurring in 1286, when Philippe le Bel remitted the fines accruing
to him from a duel between two squires adjudged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the royal court of Tours. The seneschal of Anjou and Touraine
brought suit before the Parlement of Paris to recover one-third
of the amount, as he was entitled to that proportion of
all dues arising from combats held within his jurisdiction, and
he argued that the liberality of the king was not to be exercised
to his disadvantage. His claim was pronounced just, and a
verdict was rendered in his favor.<a id="FNanchor_735_735" href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></p>

<p>But the loss of money was less important than the curtailment
of privilege and the threatened absorption of power of
which this reform was the precursor. Every step in advancing
the influence of peaceful justice, as expounded by the jurists
of the royal courts, was a heavy blow to the independence of
the feudatories. They felt their ancestral rights assailed at
the weakest point, and they instinctively recognized that, as
the jurisdiction of the royal bailiffs became extended, and as
appeals to the court of the Parlement of Paris became more
frequent, their importance was diminished, and their means of
exercising a petty tyranny over those around them were
abridged. Entangled in the mazes of a code in which the
unwonted maxims of Roman law were daily quoted with increasing
veneration, the impetuous seigneur found himself the
prey of those whom he despised, and he saw that subtle lawyers
were busily undoing the work at which his ancestors had
labored for centuries. These feelings are well portrayed in a
song of the period, exhumed not long since by Le Roux de
Lincy. Written apparently by one of the sufferers, it gives so
truthful a view of the conservative ideas of the thirteenth
century that a translation of the first stanza may not be
amiss:—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Even legists—de Fontaines, whose admiration of the Digest
led him on all occasions to seek an incongruous alliance between
the customary and imperial law, and Beaumanoir, who
in most things was far in advance of his age, and who assisted
so energetically in the work of centralization—even these enlightened
lawyers hesitate to object to the principles involved
in the battle trial, and while disapproving of the custom, express
their views in language which contrasts strongly with
the vigorous denunciations of Frederic II. half a century
earlier.<a id="FNanchor_737_737" href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a></p>

<p>How powerful were the influences thus brought to bear
against the innovation is shown by the fact that when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
mild but firm hand of St. Louis no longer grasped the sceptre,
his son and successor could not maintain his father’s laws. In
1280 there is a record of a duel adjudged in the king’s court
between Jeanne de la Valete and the Sire of Montricher on an
accusation of arson;<a id="FNanchor_738_738" href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> and about 1283 Philippe even allowed
himself to preside at a judicial duel, scarcely more than twenty
years after the promulgation of the ordonnance of prohibition.<a id="FNanchor_739_739" href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a>
The next monarch, Philippe le Bel, was at first guilty of the
same weakness, for when in 1293 the Count of Armagnac
accused Raymond Bernard of Foix of treason, a duel between
them was decreed, and they were compelled to fight before
the king at Gisors; though Robert d’Artois interfered after
the combat had commenced, and induced Philippe to separate
the antagonists.<a id="FNanchor_740_740" href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> Philippe, however, was too astute not to see
that his interests lay in humbling feudalism in all its forms;
while the rapid extension of the jurisdiction of the crown, and
the limitations on the seignorial courts, so successfully invented
and asserted by the lawyers, acting by means of the Parlement
through the royal bailiffs, gave him power to carry his
views into effect such as had been enjoyed by none of his
predecessors. Able and unscrupulous, he took full advantage
of his opportunities in every way, and the wager of battle was
not long in experiencing the effect of his encroachments. Still,
he proceeded step by step, and the vacillation of his legislation
shows how obstinate was the spirit with which he had to deal.
In 1296 he prohibited the judicial duel in time of war, and in
1303 he was obliged to repeat the prohibition.<a id="FNanchor_741_741" href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> It was
probably not long after this that he interdicted the duel
wholly<a id="FNanchor_742_742" href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a>—possibly impelled thereto by a case occurring in 1303,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
in which he is described as forced to grant the combat between
two nobles, on an accusation of murder, very greatly against
his wishes, and in spite of all his efforts to dissuade the appellant.<a id="FNanchor_743_743" href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></p>

<p>In thus abrogating the wager of battle, Philippe le Bel was
in advance of his age. Before three years were over he was
forced to abandon the position he had assumed; and though
he gave as a reason for the restoration of the duel that its
absence had proved a fruitful source of encouragement for
crime and villany,<a id="FNanchor_744_744" href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> yet at the same time he took care to place
on record the assertion of his own conviction that it was
worthless as a means of seeking justice.<a id="FNanchor_745_745" href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> In thus legalizing it
by the Ordonnance of 1306, however, he by no means replaced
it on its former footing. It was restricted to criminal
cases involving the death penalty, excepting theft, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
only permitted when the crime was notorious, the guilt of the
accused probable, and no other evidence attainable.<a id="FNanchor_746_746" href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> The
ceremonies prescribed, moreover, were fearfully expensive, and
put it out of the reach of all except the wealthiest pleaders.
As the ordonnance, which is very carefully drawn, only refers
to appeals made by the prosecutor, it may fairly be assumed
that the defendant could merely accept the challenge and had
no right to offer it.</p>

<p>Even with these limitations, Philippe was not disposed to
sanction the practice within the domains of the crown, for,
the next year (1307), we find him commanding the seneschal
of Toulouse to allow no duel to be adjudged in his court, but
to send all cases in which the combat might arise to the Parlement
of Paris for decision.<a id="FNanchor_747_747" href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> This was equivalent to a formal
prohibition. During the whole of the period under consideration,
numerous causes came before the Parlement concerning
challenges to battle, on appeals from various jurisdictions
throughout the country, and it is interesting to observe how
uniformly some valid reason was found for its refusal. In the
public register of decisions, extending from 1254 to 1318,
scarcely a single example of its permission is to be found.<a id="FNanchor_748_748" href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a>
One doubtful instance which I have observed is a curious
case occurring in 1292, wherein a man accused a woman of
homicide in the court of the Chapter of Soissons, and the
royal officers interfered on the ground that the plaintiff was a
bastard. As by the local custom he thus was in some sort a
serf of the crown, they assumed that he could not risk his
body without the express permission of the king. The
Chapter contended for the appellant’s legitimacy, and the
case became so much obscured by the loss of the record of
examination made, that the Parlement finally shuffled it out of
court without any definite decision.<a id="FNanchor_749_749" href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>Two decisions, in 1309, show that the Ordonnance of 1306
was in force, for while they admit that the duel was legally
possible, the cases are settled by inquest as capable of proof
by investigation. One of these was an incident in the old
quarrel between the Counts of Foix and Armagnac, and its
decision shows how great a stride had been made since their
duel of 1293. Raymond de Cardone, a kinsman of Foix,
gaged his battle in the king’s court against Armagnac;
Armagnac did the same against Foix and claimed that his
challenge had priority over that of Raymond, while Bernard
de Comminges also demanded battle of Foix. All these challenges
arose out of predatory border incursions between these
nobles, and in its verdict the Parlement refuses to grant the
combat in any of them, orders all the parties to swear peace
and give bail to keep it, and moreover condemns Foix in heavy
damages to his adversaries and to the king, whose territories
he had invaded in one of his forays. The Count of Foix
made some objection to submitting to the sentence, but a short
imprisonment brought him to his senses.<a id="FNanchor_750_750" href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> A more thorough
vindication of the royal jurisdiction over powerful feudatories
could scarcely be imagined, and the work of the civil lawyers
seemed to be perfectly accomplished. It was the same with
all the variety of cases involving the duel which were brought
to the cognizance of the Parlement. Some ingenious excuse
was always found for refusing it, whether by denying the
jurisdiction of the court which had granted it, or by alleging
other reasons more or less frivolous, the evident intention of
all the <i>arrêts</i> being to restrict the custom, as allowed under
the ordonnance, within limits so narrow as to render it
practically a nullity. The astute lawyers who composed the
royal court knew too well the work committed to them to
hesitate as to their conclusions, while Philippe’s distaste for
the duel probably received a stimulus when, at the Council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Vienne in 1312 he endeavored to obtain the condemnation of
the memory of Boniface VIII., and two Catalan knights offered
to prove by the single combat that the late pope had been
legitimately elected and had not been a heretic.<a id="FNanchor_751_751" href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></p>

<p>In spite of these efforts, the progress of reform was slow.
On the breaking out afresh of the perennial contest with
Flanders, Philippe found himself, in 1314, obliged to repeat
his order of 1296, forbidding all judicial combats during the
war, and holding suspended such as were in progress.<a id="FNanchor_752_752" href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> As
these duels could have little real importance in crippling his
military resources, it is evident that he seized such occasions
to accomplish under the war power what his peaceful prerogative
was unable to effect, and it is a striking manifestation
of his zeal in the cause, that he could turn aside to give attention
to it amid the preoccupations of the exhausting struggle
with the Flemings. Yet how little impression he made, and
how instinctively the popular mind still turned to the battle
ordeal, as the surest resource in all cases of doubt, is well
illustrated by a passage in a rhyming chronicle of the day.
When the close of Philippe’s long and prosperous reign was
darkened by the terrible scandal of his three daughters-in-law,
and two of them were convicted of adultery, Godefroy de
Paris makes the third, Jeanne, wife of Philippe le Long, offer
at once to prove her innocence by the combat:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The iron hand of Philippe was no sooner withdrawn than
the nobles made desperate efforts to throw off the yoke which
he had so skilfully and relentlessly imposed on them. His
son, Louis Hutin, not yet firmly seated on the throne, was
constrained to yield a portion of the newly-acquired prerogative.
The nobles of Burgundy, for instance, in their formal
list of grievances, demanded the restoration of the wager of
battle as a right of the accused in criminal cases, and Louis
was obliged to promise that they should enjoy it according to
ancient custom.<a id="FNanchor_754_754" href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> Those of Amiens and Vermandois were
equally clamorous, and for their benefit he re-enacted the
Ordonnance of 1306, permitting the duel in criminal prosecutions
where other evidence was deficient, with an important
extension authorizing its application to cases of theft, in
opposition to previous usage.<a id="FNanchor_755_755" href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> A legal record, compiled
about 1325 to illustrate the customs of Picardy, shows by a
group of cases that it was still quite common, and that indeed
it was the ordinary defence in accusations of homicide.<a id="FNanchor_756_756" href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a>
The nobles of Champagne demanded similar privileges, but
Louis, by the right of his mother, Jeanne de Champagne, was
Count of Champagne, and his authority was less open to
dispute. He did not venture on a decided refusal, but an
evasive answer, which was tantamount to a denial of the request,<a id="FNanchor_757_757" href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a>
showed that his previous concessions were extorted,
and not willingly granted. Not content with this, the Champenois
repeated their demand, and received the dry response,
that the existing edicts on the subject must be observed.<a id="FNanchor_758_758" href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>The threatened disturbances were avoided, and during the
succeeding years the centralization of jurisdiction in the royal
courts made rapid progress. It is a striking evidence of the
successful working of the plans of St. Louis and Philippe le
Bel that several ordonnances and charters granted by Philippe
le Long in 1318 and 1319, while promising reforms in the
procedures of the bailiffs and seneschals, and in the manner
of holding inquests, are wholly silent on the subject of the
duel, affording a fair inference that complaints on that score
were no longer made.<a id="FNanchor_759_759" href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> Philip of Valois was especially energetic
in maintaining the royal jurisdiction, and when in 1330
he was obliged to restrict the abusive use of appeals from the
local courts to the Parlement,<a id="FNanchor_760_760" href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> it is evident that the question
of granting or withholding the wager of battle had become
practically a prerogative of the crown. That the challenging
of witnesses must ere long have fallen into desuetude is shown
by an edict of Charles VI., issued in 1396, by which he
ordered that the testimony of women should be received in
evidence in all the courts throughout his kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_761_761" href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a></p>

<p>Though the duel was thus deprived, in France, of its importance
as an ordinary legal procedure, yet it was by no
means extinguished, nor had it lost its hold upon the confidence
of the people. An instructive illustration of this is
afforded by the well-known story of the Dog of Montargis.
Though the learned Bullet<a id="FNanchor_762_762" href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> has demonstrated the fabulous
nature of this legend, and has traced its paternity up to the
Carlovingian romances, still, the fact is indubitable that it was
long believed to have occurred in 1371, under the reign of
Charles le Sage, and that authors nearly contemporary with
that period recount the combat of the dog and the knight as
an unquestionable fact, admiring greatly the sagacity of the
animal, and regarding as a matter of course both the extra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>ordinary
judicial proceedings and the righteous judgment of
God which gave the victory to the greyhound.</p>

<p>In 1371 there was battle gaged between Sir Thomas Felton,
Seneschal of Aquitaine, and Raymond de Caussade, Seigneur
de Puycornet. Apparently they felt that a fair field could not
be had in either French or English territory, and they applied
to Pedro el Ceremonioso of Aragon to provide the lists for
them. Pedro acceded to the request and promised to preside,
provided there was due cause for a judicial duel and that the
arms were agreed upon in advance, and he sent the combatants
safe-conducts to come to Aragon. He assigned the city
of Valencia as the place of combat, and when there was an
endeavor to break off the affair on the ground that it concerned
the kings of France and England, he replied that it
was now too late and that the battle must take place.<a id="FNanchor_763_763" href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a></p>

<p>In 1386, the Parlement of Paris was occupied with a subtle
discussion as to whether the accused was obliged, in cases
where battle was gaged, to give the lie to the appellant, under
pain of being considered to confess the crime charged, and
it was decided that the lie was not essential.<a id="FNanchor_764_764" href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> The same year
occurred the celebrated duel between the Chevalier de
Carrouges and Jacques le Gris, to witness which the king
shortened a campaign, and in which the appellant was
seconded by Waleran, Count of St. Pol, son-in-law of the
Black Prince. Nothing can well be more impressive than the
scene so picturesquely described by Froissart. The cruelly
wronged Dame de Carrouges, clothed in black, is mounted on
a sable scaffold, watching the varying chances of the unequal
combat between her husband, weakened by disease, and his
vigorous antagonist, with the fearful certainty that, if strength
alone prevail, he must die a shameful death and she be consigned
to the stake. Hope grows faint and fainter; a grievous
wound seems to place Carrouges at the mercy of his adversary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
until at the last moment, when all appeared lost, she sees the
avenger drive his sword through the body of his prostrate
enemy, vindicating at once his wife’s honor and his own good
cause.<a id="FNanchor_765_765" href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> Froissart, however, was rather an artist than an historian;
he would not risk the effect of his picture by too rigid
an adherence to facts, and he omits to mention, what is told
by the cooler Juvenal des Ursins, that Le Gris was subsequently
proved innocent by the death-bed confession of the
real offender.<a id="FNanchor_766_766" href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> To make the tragedy complete, the Anonyme
de S. Denis adds that the miserable Dame de Carrouges, overwhelmed
with remorse at having unwittingly caused the disgrace
and death of an innocent man, ended her days in a convent.<a id="FNanchor_767_767" href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a>
So striking a proof of the injustice of the battle ordeal
is said by some writers to have caused the abandonment of the
practice; but this, as will be seen, is an error, though no
further trace of the combat as a judicial procedure is to be
found on the registers of the Parlement of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_768_768" href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a></p>

<p>Still, it was popularly regarded as an unfailing resource.
Thus, in 1390, two women were accused at the Châtelet of
Paris of sorcery. After repeated torture, a confession implicating
both was extracted from one of them, but the other
persisted in her denial, and challenged her companion to the
duel by way of disproving her evidence. In the record of
the proceedings the challenge is duly entered, but no notice
whatever seems to have been taken of it by the court, showing
that it was no longer a legal mode of trial in such cases.<a id="FNanchor_769_769" href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a></p>

<p>In 1409, the battle trial was materially limited by an ordonnance
of Charles VI. prohibiting its employment except
when specially granted by the king or the Parlement;<a id="FNanchor_770_770" href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
though the latter body may never have exercised the privilege
thus conferred upon it, the king occasionally did, as we
find him during the same year presiding at a judicial duel
between Guillaume Bariller, a Breton knight, and John Carrington,
an Englishman.<a id="FNanchor_771_771" href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> The English occupation of France,
under Henry V. and the Regent Bedford, revived the practice,
and removed for a time the obstacles to its employment.
Nicholas Upton, writing in the middle of the fifteenth century,
repeatedly alludes to the numerous cases in which he
assisted as officer of the Earl of Salisbury, Lieutenant of the
King of England; and in his chapters devoted to defining
the different species of duel he betrays a singular confusion
between the modern ideas of reparation of honor and the
original object of judicial investigation, thus fairly illustrating
the transitional character of the period.<a id="FNanchor_772_772" href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a></p>

<p>It was about this time that Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy,
formally abolished the wager of battle, as far as lay in
his power, throughout the extensive dominions of which he
was sovereign, and in the Coutumier of Burgundy, as revised
by him in 1459, there is no trace of it to be found. The code
in force in Britanny until 1539 permitted it in cases of contested
estates, and of treason, theft, and perjury—the latter,
as usual, extending it over a considerable range of civil actions,
while the careful particularization of details by the code shows
that it was not merely a judicial antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_773_773" href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> In Normandy,
the legal existence of the judicial duel was even more prolonged,
for it was not until the revision of the coutumier in
1583, under Henry III., that the privilege of deciding in this
way numerous cases, both civil and criminal, was formally
abolished.<a id="FNanchor_774_774" href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> Still, it may be assumed that, practically, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
custom had long been obsolete, though the tardy process of
revising the local customs allowed it to remain upon the statute
book to so late a date. The fierce mountaineers of remote
Béarn clung to it more obstinately, and in the last revision of
their code, in 1552, which remained unaltered until 1789, it
retains its place as a legitimate means of proof, in default of
other testimony, with a heavy penalty on the party who did
not appear upon the field at the appointed time.<a id="FNanchor_775_775" href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a></p>

<p>During this long period, examples are to be found which
show that although the combat was falling into disuse, it was
still a legal procedure, which in certain cases could be claimed
as a right, or which could be decreed and enforced by competent
judicial authority. Among the privileges of the town
of Valenciennes was one to the effect that any homicide taking
refuge there could swear that the act had been committed
in self-defence, when he could be appealed only in battle.
This gave occasion to a combat in 1455 between a certain
Mahuot and Jacotin Plouvier, the former of whom had killed
a kinsman of the latter. Neither party desired the battle, but
the municipal government insisted upon it, and furnished them
with instructors to teach the use of the club and buckler
allowed as arms. The Comte de Charolois, Charles le Téméraire,
endeavored to prevent the useless cruelty, but the city
held any interference as an infringement of its chartered rights;
and, after long negotiations, Philippe le Bon, the suzerain,
authorized the combat and was present at it. The combatants,
according to custom, had the head shaved and the nails
pared on both hands and feet; they were dressed from head
to foot in a tight-fitting suit of hardened leather, and each was
anointed with grease to prevent his antagonist from clutching
him. The combat was long and desperate, but at length the
appellant literally tore out the heart of his antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_776_776" href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
incidents among roturiers, however, were rare. More frequently
some fiery gentleman claimed the right of vindicating
his quarrel at the risk of his life. Thus, in 1482, shortly after
the battle of Nancy had reinstated René, Duke of Lorraine,
on the ruins of the second house of Burgundy, two gentlemen
of the victor’s court, quarrelling over the spoils of the battle-field,
demanded the <i>champ-clos</i>; it was duly granted, and on
the appointed day the appellant was missing, to the great discomfiture
and no little loss of his bail.<a id="FNanchor_777_777" href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> When Charles d’Armagnac,
in 1484, complained to the States General of the
inhuman destruction of his family, committed by order of
Louis XI., the Sieur de Castlenau, whom he accused of having
poisoned his mother, the Comtesse d’Armagnac, appeared
before the assembly, and, his advocate denying the charge,
presented his offer to prove his innocence by single combat.<a id="FNanchor_778_778" href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>
In 1518, Henry II. of Navarre ordered a judicial duel at Pau
between two contestants, of whom the appellant made default;
the defendant was accordingly pronounced innocent, and was
empowered to drag through all cities, villages, and other
places through which he might pass, the escutcheon and effigy
of his adversary, who was further punished by the prohibition
thenceforth to wear arms or knightly bearings.<a id="FNanchor_779_779" href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> In 1538,
Francis I. granted the combat between Jean du Plessis and
Gautier de Dinteville, which would appear to have been essentially
a judicial proceeding, since the defendant, not appearing
at the appointed time, was condemned to death by sentence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of the high council, Feb. 20, 1538.<a id="FNanchor_780_780" href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> The duel thus was evidently
still a matter of law, which vindicated its majesty by
punishing the unlucky contestant who shrank from the arbitrament
of the sword.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the celebrated combat
between Chastaigneraye and Jarnac, in 1547, wherein the
death of the former, a favorite of Henry II., led the monarch
to take a solemn oath never to authorize another judicial duel.
Two years later, two young nobles of his court, Jacques de
Fontaine, Sieur de Fendilles, and Claude des Guerres, Baron
de Vienne-le-Chatel, desired to settle in this manner a disgusting
accusation brought against the latter by the former. The
king, having debarred himself from granting the appeal, arranged
the matter by allowing Robert de la Marck, Marshal
of France, and sovereign Prince of Sedan, to permit it in the
territory of which he was suzerain. Fendilles was so sure of
success that he refused to enter the lists until a gallows was
erected and a stake lighted, where his adversary after defeat
was to be gibbeted and burned. Their only weapons were
broad-swords, and at the first pass Fendilles inflicted on his
opponent a fearful gash in the thigh. Des Guerres, seeing that
loss of blood would soon reduce him to extremity, closed with
his antagonist, and being a skilful wrestler speedily threw
him. Reduced to his natural weapons, he could only inflict
blows with the fist, which failing strength rendered less and
less effective, when a scaffold crowded with ladies and gentlemen
gave way, throwing down the spectators in a shrieking
mass. Taking advantage of the confusion, the friends of Des
Guerres violated the law which imposed absolute silence and
neutrality on all, and called to him to blind and suffocate his
adversary with sand. Des Guerres promptly took the hint,
and Fendilles succumbed to this unknightly weapon. Whether
he formally yielded or not was disputed. Des Guerres claimed
that he should undergo the punishment of the gallows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
stake prepared for himself, but de la Marck interfered, and
the combatants were both suffered to retire in peace.<a id="FNanchor_781_781" href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> This is
the last recorded instance of the wager of battle in France.
The custom appears never to have been formally abolished,
and so little did it represent the thoughts and feelings of the
age which witnessed the Reformation, that when, in 1566,
Charles IX. issued an edict prohibiting duels, no allusion was
made to the judicial combat. The encounters which he sought
to prevent were solely those which arose from points of honor
between gentlemen, and the offended party was ordered not
to appeal to the courts, but to lay his case before the Marshals
of France, or the governor of his province.<a id="FNanchor_782_782" href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> The custom had
died a natural death. No ordonnance was necessary to abrogate
it; and, seemingly, from forgetfulness, the crown and the
Parlement appear never to have been divested of the right to
adjudge the wager of battle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Italy many causes conspired to lead to the abrogation of
the judicial duel. On the one hand there were the prescriptions
of the popes, and on the other the spirit of scepticism
fostered by the example of Frederic II. The influence of the
resuscitated Roman law was early felt and its principles were
diffused by the illustrious jurists who rendered the Italian
schools famous. Burgher life, moreover, was precociously
developed in the social and political organization, and as the
imperial influence diminished with the fall of the House of
Hohenstaufen, the cities assumed self-government and fashioned
their local legislation after their own ideals. The judgments
of God were not indigenous in Italy; they were not
ancestral customs rooted in the prehistoric past, but were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
foreign devices introduced by conquerors—first by the Lombards
and then by the Othos. There were thus many reasons
why the trial by combat should disappear early from the Italian
statute books. There is no trace of it in the elaborate criminal
code of Milan compiled in 1338, nor in that of Piacenza
somewhat later; in fact, it was no longer needed, for the inquisitional
process was in full operation and in doubtful cases
the judge had all the resources of torture at his disposal.<a id="FNanchor_783_783" href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a></p>

<p>Although by the middle of the fourteenth century it had
thus disappeared from the written law, the rulers retained the
right to grant it in special cases, and it thus continued in existence
as a lawful though extra-legal mode of settling disputed
cases. Where suzerains were so numerous there was thus
ample opportunity for belligerent pleaders to gratify their
desires. Even as late as 1507 Giovanni Paolo Baglioni, lord
of Spello (a village in the Duchy of Spoleto, near Foligno),
granted a licence for a month to Giovanni Batta Gaddi and
Raffaello Altoviti to settle their suits by fighting within his
domain with three comrades.<a id="FNanchor_784_784" href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> Two years after this, Julius
II., in issuing a constitution directed against duels of honor,
took occasion also to include in his prohibition all such <i>purgationes
vulgares</i>, even though permitted by the laws; the
combatants were ordered, in all the States of the Church, to be
arrested and punished for homicide or maiming according to
the common law.<a id="FNanchor_785_785" href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> In 1519 Leo X. reissued this bull with
vastly sharper penalties on all concerned, but in his additions
to it he seems merely to have in mind the duel of honor, which
was habitually conducted in public, in lists prepared for the
purpose, and in presence of the prince or noble who had
granted licence for it.<a id="FNanchor_786_786" href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> The legal combat may be considered
to have virtually disappeared, but the duel of honor which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
succeeded it inherited some of its sanctions, and in the learned
treatises on the subject which appeared during the first half of
the sixteenth century there are still faint traces to be found of
the survival of the idea of the judgment of God.<a id="FNanchor_787_787" href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></p>

<p>In Hungary, it was not until 1486 that any attempt was
made to restrict the judicial duel. In that year Matthias Corvinus
prohibited it in cases where direct testimony was procurable:
where such evidence was unattainable, he still permitted
it, both in civil and criminal matters.<a id="FNanchor_788_788" href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> In 1492
Vladislas II. repeated this prohibition, alleging as his reason
for the restriction the almost universal employment of champions
who sometimes sold out their principals. The terms
of the decree show that previously its use was general, though
it is declared to be a custom unknown elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_789_789" href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a></p>

<p>In Flanders, it is somewhat remarkable that the duel should
have lingered until late in the sixteenth century, although, as
we have seen above, the commercial spirit of that region had
sought its abrogation at a very early period, and had been
seconded by the efforts of Philippe le Bon in the fifteenth century.
Damhouder, writing about the middle of the sixteenth
century, states that it was still legal in matters of public concern,
and even his severe training as a civil lawyer cannot
prevent his declaring it to be laudable in such affairs.<a id="FNanchor_790_790" href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> Indeed,
when the Council of Trent, in 1563, stigmatized the
duel as the work of the devil and prohibited all potentates
from granting it under pain of excommunication and forfeiture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
of all feudal possessions,<a id="FNanchor_791_791" href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> the state Council of Flanders, in
their report to the Duchess of Parma on the reception of the
Council, took exception to this canon, and decided that the
ruler ought not to be deprived of the power of ordering the
combat.<a id="FNanchor_792_792" href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> In this view, the Council of Namur agreed.<a id="FNanchor_793_793" href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></p>

<p>In Germany, in spite of the imperial legislation referred to
above (p. 212), feudal influences were too strong to permit an
early abrogation of the custom. Throughout the fifteenth
century the wager of battle continued to flourish, and MSS. of
the period give full directions as to the details of the various
procedures for patricians and plebeians. The sixteenth century
saw its wane, though it kept its place in the statute books,
and <i>Fechtbücher</i> of 1543 and 1556 describe fully the use of
the club and the knife. Yet when in 1535 Friedrich von
Schwartzenberg demanded a judicial duel to settle a suit with
Ludwig von Hutten, the latter contemptuously replied that
such things might be permitted in the times of Goliath and
Dietrich of Bern, but that now they were not in accordance
with law, right, or custom, and von Schwartzenberg was
obliged to settle the case in more peaceful fashion. Still,
occasional instances of its use are said to have occurred until
the close of the century,<a id="FNanchor_794_794" href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> and as late as 1607, Henry, Duke of
Lorraine, procured from the Emperor Rodolph II. the confirmation
of a privilege which he claimed as ancestral that all
combats occurring between the Rhine and the Meuse should
be fought out in his presence.<a id="FNanchor_795_795" href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p>

<p>In Russia, under the code known as the Ulogenié Zakonof,
promulgated in 1498, any culprit, after his accuser’s testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
was in, could claim the duel; and as both parties went to the
field accompanied by all the friends they could muster, the
result was not infrequently a bloody skirmish. These abuses
were put an end to by the Sudebtnick, issued in 1550, and the
duel was regulated after a more decent fashion, but it continued
to flourish legally until it was finally abrogated in 1649 by the
Czar Alexis Mikhailovich, in the code known as the Sobornoié
Ulogenié. The more enlightened branch of the Slavonic race,
however, the Poles, abolished it in the fourteenth century; but
Macieiowski states that in Servia and Bulgaria the custom has
been preserved to the present day.<a id="FNanchor_796_796" href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></p>

<p>In other countries, the custom likewise lingered to a comparatively
late period. Scotland, indeed, was somewhat more
forward than her neighbors; for in the year 1400, her Parliament
showed the influence of advancing civilization by limiting
the practice in several important particulars, which, if
strictly observed, must have rendered it almost obsolete. Four
conditions were pronounced essential prerequisites: the accusation
must be for a capital crime; the offence must have been
committed secretly and by treachery; reasonable cause of suspicion
must be shown against the accused, and direct testimony
both of witnesses and documents must be wanting.<a id="FNanchor_797_797" href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">797</a></p>

<p>Still the “perfervidum ingenium Scotorum” clung to the
arbitrament of the sword with great tenacity. In 1532 Sir
James Douglass accused his son-in-law Robert Charteris of
treason, and the charge was settled by a judicial duel in the
presence of James V., who put an end to it when Charteri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>s’s
sword broke.<a id="FNanchor_798_798" href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> Knox relates that in 1562, when the Earl of
Arran was consulting with him and others respecting a proposed
accusation against Bothwell for high treason, arising out
of a plan for seizing Queen Mary which Bothwell had suggested,
the earl remarked, “I know that he will offer the combate unto
me, but that would not be suffered in France, but I will do
that which I have proposed.” In 1567, also, when Bothwell
underwent a mock trial for the murder of Darnley, he offered
to justify himself by the duel; and when the Lords of the
Congregation took up arms against him, alleging as a reason
the murder and his presumed designs against the infant James
VI., Queen Mary’s proclamation against the rebels recites his
challenge as a full disproval of the charges. When the
armies were drawn up at Carberry Hill, Bothwell again came
forward and renewed his challenge. James Murray, who had
already offered to accept it, took it up at once, but Bothwell
refused to meet him on account of the inequality in their rank.
Murray’s brother, William of Tullibardin, then offered himself,
and Bothwell again declined, as the Laird of Tullibardin
was not a peer of the realm. Many nobles then eagerly proposed
to take his place, and Lord Lindsay especially insisted
on being allowed the privilege of proving the charge on Bothwell’s
body, but the latter delayed on various pretexts, until
Queen Mary was able to prohibit the combat.<a id="FNanchor_799_799" href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> The last
judicial duels fought in Scotland were two which occurred as
the sixteenth century was closing. In 1595, under a warrant
from James VI. John Brown met George Hepburn and was
vanquished, though his life was spared at the request of the
judges. In 1597 Adam Bruntfield charged James Carmichael
with causing the death of his brother, and under royal licence
fought and slew him before a crowd of five thousand spectators.
Yet even this was not the end of the legal custom, for in 1603
an accusation of treason against Francis Mowbray was ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>judged
to be settled by the duel, though the combat was prevented
by Mowbray meeting his death in an attempt to escape
from prison, after which he was duly hanged and quartered.<a id="FNanchor_800_800" href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">800</a></p>

<p>In England, the resolute conservatism, which resists innovation
to the last, prolonged the existence of the wager of
battle until a period unknown in other enlightened nations.
No doubt a reason for this may be found in the rise of the jury
trial towards the end of the twelfth century, which, as we
have seen above (p. 144), furnished an effective substitute for
the combat in doubtful cases. As the jury system developed
itself in both civil and criminal matters the sphere of the duel
became more limited, in practice if not in theory, and its evils
being thus less felt the necessity for its formal abrogation was
less pressing.<a id="FNanchor_801_801" href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> It was thus enabled to hold its place as a
recognized form of procedure to a later period than in any
other civilized land. Already in the first quarter of the
thirteenth century Mr. Maitland tells us that in criminal cases
it had become uncommon, but the number of examples of it
which he gives shows that this can only be in comparison with
its greater frequency in the preceding century and that it was
still in common use notwithstanding the tendency of the judges
to disallow it.<a id="FNanchor_802_802" href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> At the close of the fourteenth century, when
France was engaged in rendering it rapidly obsolete, Thomas,
Duke of Gloucester, dedicated to his nephew Richard II. a
treatise detailing elaborately the practice followed in the
Marshal’s court with respect to judicial duels.<a id="FNanchor_803_803" href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> Even a century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
later, legislation was obtained to prevent its avoidance in
certain cases. The “Statute of Gloucester” (6 Ed. II. cap.
9), in 1333, had given to the appellant a year and a day in
which to bring his appeal of death—a privilege allowed the
widow or next of kin to put the accused on a second trial
after an acquittal on a public indictment—which, as a private
suit, was usually determined by the combat. In practice, this
privilege was generally rendered unavailing by postponing the
public prosecution until the expiration of the delay, so as to
prevent the appeal. In 1486, however, a law was passed to
diminish the frequency of murder, which required the trial to
be finished before the expiration of the year and day, and
ordered the justices, in case of acquittal, to hold the defendant
in prison or on bail until the time had passed, so as to insure
to the widow or next of kin the opportunity of prosecuting
the appeal of death.<a id="FNanchor_804_804" href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> Another evidence of the prevalence of
the custom is to be found in the rule which, in the fifteenth
century, permitted a priest to shrive a man who was about to
wage his battle, without regard to the fact as to whose parishioner
he might legally be—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>With the advance of civilization and refinement, the custom
gradually declined, but it was not abolished. The last duel
fought out in England is said to be one in 1492 between Sir
James Parker and Hugh Vaughan, arising from a grant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
armorial bearings to Vaughan; it was fought on horseback
with lances, and at the first course Vaughan slew his antagonist.<a id="FNanchor_806_806" href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a>
Still the old laws remained unaltered, and an occasional
appeal to them, while it offended men’s common sense, was
insufficient to cause their repeal. In 1571 a case occurred, as
Spelman says, “non sine magna jurisconsultorum perturbatione,”
when, to determine the title to an estate in Kent,
Westminster Hall was forced to adjourn to Tothill Fields, and
all the preliminary forms of a combat were literally enacted
with the most punctilious exactness, though an accommodation
between the parties saved the skulls of their champions.<a id="FNanchor_807_807" href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> In
1583, however, a judicial duel was actually fought in Ireland
between two O’Connors on an accusation of treason brought
by one against the other, which ended by the appellant cutting
off the defendant’s head and presenting it on his sword’s point
to the justices.<a id="FNanchor_808_808" href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a></p>

<p>A device, peculiar to the English jurisprudence, allowed a
man indicted for a capital offence to turn “approver,” by
confessing the crime and charging or appealing any one he
choose as an accomplice, and this appeal was usually settled by
the single combat. Indeed, even when a criminal had confessed
he was sometimes pardoned on condition of his being
victorious in a specified number of duels, and thus compounding
for his own life by the service rendered to society in relieving
it of so many malefactors, as in a case in 1221 where
a confessed thief “became approver to fight five battles.”<a id="FNanchor_809_809" href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
The custom continued to be a feature of criminal jurisprudence
sufficiently important to require legislation as late as the year
1599, when the Act 41 Eliz. chap. 3 was passed to regulate
the nice questions which attended appeals of several persons
against one, or of one person against several. In the former
case, the appellee, if victorious in the first duel, was acquitted;
in the latter, the appellor was obliged to fight successively
with all the appellees.<a id="FNanchor_810_810" href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> In civil suits the last case on record,
I believe, is that of Claxton <i>v.</i> Lilburn, which shows curiously
enough the indisposition to put an end to what was regarded
by common consent as a solecism. A valuable estate in Durham,
said to be worth more than £200 a year, was the subject
in dispute. Claxton had been unsuccessful in a suit for its
recovery, and had brought a new action, to which Lilburn responded,
Aug. 6th, 1638, by producing in court his champion,
George Cheney, in array, armed with a sandbag and battoon,
who cast into the court his gauntlet with five small pence in
it, and demanded battle. Claxton rejoined by producing a
champion similarly armed, and gaged his battle. The court
was nonplussed, putting off the proceedings from day to day,
and seeking some excuse for refusing the combat. The
champions were interrogated, and both admitted that they
were hired for money. King Charles demanded the opinion
of the Chief Justice and all his barons whether this was sufficient
to invalidate the proceedings, but they unanimously replied
that after battle was gaged and sureties given, such
confession was no bar to its being carried out. The King
then ordered his judges if possible to find some just way for
its prevention, but they apparently could do nothing save procrastinate
the matter for years, for in 1641 Lilburn petitioned
the Long Parliament, setting forth that he had repeatedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
claimed his right of battle and had produced his champion,
but was ever put off by the judges finding some error in the
record. Parliament thereupon ordered a bill to be brought
in taking away the judicial combat.<a id="FNanchor_811_811" href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> It was not enacted however,
and Sir Matthew Hale, writing towards the close of the
century, feels obliged to describe with considerable minuteness
the various niceties of the law, though he is able to speak of
the combat as “an unusual trial at this day.”<a id="FNanchor_812_812" href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></p>

<p>In 1774, the subject incidentally attracted attention in a
manner not very creditable to the enlightenment of English
legislation. When, to punish the rebellious Bostonians for
destroying the obnoxious tea, a “Bill for the improved administration
of justice in the province of Massachusetts Bay”
was passed, it originally contained a clause depriving the
New Englanders of the appeal of death, by which, it will be
remembered, a man acquitted of a charge of murder could
be again prosecuted by the next of kin, and the question
could be determined by the wager of battle. The denial of
this ancestral right aroused the indignation of the liberal
party in the House of Commons, and the point was warmly
contested. The learned and eloquent Dunning, afterwards
Lord Ashburton, one of the leaders of opposition, defended
the ancient custom in the strongest terms. “I rise,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
“to support that great pillar of the constitution, the appeal for
murder; I fear there is a wish to establish a precedent for
taking it away in England as well as in the colonies. It is
called a remnant of barbarism and gothicism. The whole of
our constitution, for aught I know, is gothic.... I
wish, sir, that gentlemen would be a little more cautious, and
consider that the yoke we are framing for the despised colonists
may be tied round our own necks!” Even Burke was
heard to lift a warning voice against the proposed innovation,
and the obnoxious clause had to be struck out before the
ministerial majority could pass the bill.<a id="FNanchor_813_813" href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> Something was said
about reforming the law throughout the empire, but it was not
done, and the beauty of the “great pillar of the constitution,”
the appeal of death, was shown when the nineteenth century
was disgraced by the resurrection of all the barbaric elements
of criminal jurisprudence. In 1818, the case of Ashford <i>vs.</i>
Thornton created much excitement. Ashford was the brother
of a murdered girl, whose death, under circumstances of
peculiar atrocity, was charged upon Thornton, with much
appearance of probability. Acquitted on a jury trial, Thornton
was appealed by Ashford, when he pleaded “Not guilty,
and I am ready to defend the same by my body.” After
elaborate argument, Lord Ellenborough, with the unanimous
assent of his brother justices, sustained the appellee’s right to
this as “the usual and constitutional mode of trial,” expounding
the law in almost the same terms as those which we read
in Bracton and Beaumanoir.<a id="FNanchor_814_814" href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> The curious crowd was sorely
disappointed when the appellant withdrew, and the chief justice
was relieved from the necessity of presiding over a gladiatorial
exhibition. A similar case occurred almost simultaneously
in Ireland, and the next year the Act 59 Geo. III. chap.
46, at length put an end to this remnant of Teutonic barbarism.<a id="FNanchor_815_815" href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>America, inheriting the blessings of English law, inherited
also its defects. The colonies enjoyed the privilege of the
appeal of death, against the abrogation of which, in the province
of Massachusetts Bay, Dunning protested so vehemently.
At least one instance of its employment is to be found here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
when in 1765, in Maryland, Sarah Soaper appealed a negro
slave named Tom for the murder of her husband. The negro,
however, was probably not aware of his privilege to demand
the wager of battle, so he submitted to be tried by a jury, and
was duly condemned and executed.<a id="FNanchor_816_816" href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> John C. Gray, Jr.,
Esq., of Boston, to whom I am indebted for calling my attention
to this and some other sources of information on the subject,
informs me of a tradition that a disputed question of
boundary between two townships in New Hampshire was once
settled by combat between champions; but the most conservative
State in this respect appears to be South Carolina. An
act of that colony, in 1712, enumerating the English laws to
be held in force, specifically includes those concerning appeal
of death, and Dr. Cooper, in his “Statutes at Large of South
Carolina,” writing in 1837, seems to think that both the wager
of battle and appeal of death were still legally in force there
at that time.<a id="FNanchor_817_817" href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> So Chancellor Kilty, in his Report on English
Statutes applicable to Maryland, made in 1811, apparently
considers that the appeal of death was still legally existent,
but regards it as unimportant in view of the pardoning power
and other considerations.<a id="FNanchor_818_818" href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL.</small></h2>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I-3" id="CHAPTER_I-3">CHAPTER I.</a><br />

<small>UNIVERSAL INVOCATION OF THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.</small></h3>


<p>Although the wager of battle and the other ordeals have
much in common, there is sufficient distinction between them
to render convenient their separate consideration, even at the
risk of a little occasional repetition. The development and
career of these forms of the judgment of God were not in all
respects similar, nor was their employment in all cases the
same. The mere fact that the duel was necessarily a bilateral
ordeal, to which both sides had to submit, in itself establishes
a limit as to the cases fitted for its employment, nor were all
races of mankind adapted by character for its use. Moreover,
in its origin it was simply a device for regulating under conditions
of comparative fairness the primitive law of force, and
the conception of the intervention of a Divine Power, whereby
victory would enure to the right, probably was a belief subsequently
engrafted on it. In the other ordeals this is the fundamental
idea on which they were based, and we may perhaps
assume that they represent a later development in human
progress, in which brute strength has declined somewhat from
its earliest savage supremacy, and a reliance upon the interposition
of a superhuman agency, whether the spirit of a fetish
or an omnipotent and just Godhead, single or multiform, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
grown sufficiently strong to be a controlling principle in the
guidance of daily life.</p>

<p>Yet this, too, is only a step in the evolution of human
thought, before it can grasp the conception of an Omnipotence
that shall work out its destined ends, and yet allow its
mortal creatures free scope to mould their own fragmentary
portions of the great whole—a Power so infinitely great that
its goodness, mercy, and justice are compatible with the existence
of evil in the world which it has formed, so that man
has full liberty to obey the dictates of his baser passions, without
being released from responsibility, and, at the same time,
without disturbing the preordained results of Divine wisdom
and beneficence. Accordingly, we find in the religious history
of almost all races that a belief in a Divine Being is
accompanied with the expectation that special manifestations
of power will be made on all occasions, and that the interposition
of Providence may be had for the asking, whenever
man, in the pride of his littleness, condescends to waive his
own judgment, and undertakes to test the inscrutable ways of
his Creator by the touchstone of his own limited reason.
Thus miracles come to be expected as matters of every-day
occurrence, and the laws of nature are to be suspended whenever
man chooses to tempt his God with the promise of right
and the threat of injustice to be committed in His name.</p>

<p>To this tendency of the human mind is attributable the
almost universal adoption of the so-called Judgment of God,
by which men, oppressed with doubt, have essayed in all ages
to relieve themselves from responsibility by calling in the
assistance of Heaven. Nor, in so doing, have they seemed
to appreciate the self-exaltation implied in the act itself, but
in all humility have cast themselves and their sorrows at the
feet of the Great Judge, making a merit of abnegating the
reason which, however limited, has been bestowed to be used
and not rejected. In the Carlovingian Capitularies there
occurs a passage, dictated doubtless by the spirit of genuine
trust in God, which well expresses the pious sentiments pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>siding
over acts of the grossest practical impiety. “Let
doubtful cases be determined by the judgment of God. The
judges may decide that which they clearly know, but that
which they cannot know shall be reserved for Divine judgment.
Whom God hath kept for his own judgment may not
be condemned by human means. ‘Therefore judge nothing
before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to
light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest
the counsels of the hearts’”<a id="FNanchor_819_819" href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> (<i>1 Cor.</i> iv. 5). That Heaven
would interpose to save the guiltless was taught in too many
ways to admit of doubt. An innocent man, we are told, was
accused of a murder and pursued till he took refuge in the
cell of St. Macarius, who at once proposed to determine the
question of his guilt by an appeal to God. Adjourning to the
grave of the slain the saint addressed a prayer to Christ and
then called upon the dead man to declare whether the accused
had killed him. A voice from the tomb responded in the
negative and the fugitive was released; but when the saint
was asked to pursue the investigation and ascertain the name
of the murderer, he replied that this was none of his duty, for
the sinner might already have repented.<a id="FNanchor_820_820" href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<p>The superstition which we here find dignified with the
forms of Christian faith manifests itself among so many races
and under such diverse stages of civilization that it may be
regarded as an inevitable incident in human evolution, only
to be outgrown at the latest periods of development. In this,
however, as in so many other particulars, China furnishes
virtually an exception. Her arrested thought exhibits itself,
in the King or sacred books collected by Confucius five hundred
years before the Christian era, in nearly the same form
as is found in the orthodox opinion of to-day. In this, religious
belief is but a system of cold morality, which avoids
the virtues as well as the errors of more imaginative faiths.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
In the most revered and authoritative of the Chinese Scriptures,
the Shu-King, or Holy Book, we find a theo-philosophy based
on a Supreme Power, <i>Tai-Ki</i>, or Heaven, which is pure
reason, or the embodiment of the laws and forces of nature
acting under the pressure of blind destiny. It is true that
some forms of divination were practised, and even enjoined,
but no fuller expression of belief in direct interposition from
above is to be found than that contained in the saying attributed
to Muh-Wang (about 1000 B. C.) in his instructions
to his judges in criminal cases: “Say not that Heaven is unjust;
it is man who brings these evils on himself. If it were
not that Heaven inflicts these severe punishments the world
would be ungoverned.”<a id="FNanchor_821_821" href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> It is, therefore, in strict compliance
with this philosophy that in the modern jurisprudence of
China there is no allusion to any evidence save that of facts
duly substantiated by witnesses, and even oaths are neither
required nor admitted in judicial proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_822_822" href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></p>

<p>These teachings, however, are too refined and sublimated
for ordinary human nature, and along-side of official Confucianism,
Taoism and Buddhism flourish with a wealth of
legends and marvels that may fairly rival the most exuberant
fancies of Teutonic or Latin mediævalism. In the popular
mind, therefore, the divine interposition may perpetually be
expected to vindicate innocence and to punish crime, and
moral teaching to a great extent consists of histories illustrating
this belief in all its phases and in every possible contingency
of common-place life. Thus it is related that in
A. D. 1626 the learned Doctor Wang-i had two servants, one
stupid and the other cunning. The latter stole from his
master a sum of money, and caused the blame to fall upon
his comrade, who was unable to justify himself. By way of
securing him, he was tied to a flagstaff, and his accuser was
set to watch him through the night. At midnight the flagstaff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
broke in twain with a loud noise, the upper portion falling
upon the guilty man and killing him, while the innocent was
left unhurt; and next morning, when the effects of the dead
man were examined, the stolen money was found among them,
thus completely establishing the innocence of his intended
victim.<a id="FNanchor_823_823" href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> Popular beliefs such as these naturally find their
expression in irregular judicial proceedings, in spite of the
strict materialism of the written law, and, at least in some
parts of China, a curious form of the ordeal of chance is
employed in default of testimony. If an injured husband
surprises his wife <i>flagrante delicto</i> he is at liberty to slay the
adulterous pair on the spot; but he must then cut off their
heads and carry them to the nearest magistrate, before whom
it is incumbent on him to prove his innocence and demonstrate
the truth of his story. As external evidence is not
often to be had in such cases, the usual mode of trial is to
place the heads in a large tub of water, which is violently
stirred. The heads, in revolving, naturally come together in
the centre, when, if they meet back to back, the victims are
pronounced guiltless, and the husband is punished as a
murderer; but if they meet face to face, the truth of his statement
is accepted as demonstrated, he is gently bastinadoed to
teach him that wives should be more closely watched, and is
presented with a small sum of money wherewith to purchase
another spouse.<a id="FNanchor_824_824" href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a></p>

<p>The cognate civilization of Japan yields even more readily
to the temptation of seeking from the Deity a solution of
doubt. Anciently there were in general use the judgments of
God, so well known in mediæval Europe, of the wager of
battle and the ordeal of boiling water, and the latter is still
customarily employed among the Ainos, or aborigines. Even
yet two antagonists may be seen to plunge their hands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
scalding water, the one who suffers the most being convicted,
while the innocent is expected to escape with injuries so slight
that they will readily heal.<a id="FNanchor_825_825" href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Turning to the still savage races of the old world we everywhere
find these superstitions in full force. Africa furnishes
an ample store of them, varying from the crudest simplicity
to the most deadly devices. Among the Kalabarese the <i>afia-edet-ibom</i>
is administered with the curved fang of a snake,
which is dexterously inserted under the lid and around the
ball of the eye of the accused; if innocent, he is expected to
eject it by rolling the eye, while, if unable to do so, it is removed
with a leopard’s tooth, and he is condemned. Even
ruder, and more under the control of the operator, is the <i>afia-ibnot-idiok</i>,
in which a white and a black line are drawn on the
skull of a chimpanzee: this is held up before the defendant,
when an apparent attraction of the white line towards him
demonstrates his innocence, or an inclination of the black line
in his direction pronounces his guilt. More formidable than
these is the ordeal-nut, containing a deadly poison which
causes frothing at the mouth, convulsions, paralysis, and
speedy death. In capital cases, or even when sickness is attributed
to hostile machinations, the <i>abiadiong</i>, or sorcerer,
decides who shall undergo the trial; and as the active principle
of the nut can be extracted by preliminary boiling, judicious
liberality on the part of the individual selected is supposed to
render the ordeal comparatively harmless.<a id="FNanchor_826_826" href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></p>

<p>Throughout a wide region of Western Africa, one of the
most popular forms of ordeal is that of the red water, or
“sassy-bark.” In the neighborhood of Sierra-Leone, as described
by Dr. Winterbottom, it is administered by requiring
the accused to fast for twelve hours, and then to swallow a
small quantity of rice. After this the infusion of the bark is
taken in large quantities, as much as a gallon being sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
employed; if it produces emesia, so as to eject all of the rice,
the proof of innocence is complete, but if it fails in this, or if
it acts as a purgative, the accused is pronounced guilty. It
has narcotic properties, also, a manifestation of which is likewise
decisive against the sufferer. Among some of the tribes
this is determined by placing on the ground small sticks about
eighteen inches apart, or by forming an archway of limbs of
trees bent to the ground, and requiring the patient to pick his
way among them, a feat rendered difficult by the vertiginous
effects of the poison. Although death not infrequently results
from the ordeal itself, yet the faith reposed in these trials is so
absolute that, according to Dr. Livingston, they are demanded
with eagerness by those accused of witchcraft, confident in
their own innocence and believing that the guilty alone can
suffer. When the red water is administered for its emetic
effects, the popular explanation is that the fetish enters with
the draught, examines the heart of the accused, and, on finding
him innocent, returns with the rice as evidence.<a id="FNanchor_827_827" href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> A
system directly the reverse of all this is found in Ashantee,
where sickness in the ordeal is a sign of innocence, and the
<i>lex talionis</i> is strictly observed. When evidence is insufficient
to support a charge, the accuser is made to take an oath as to
the truth of his accusation, and the defendant is then required
to chew a piece of <i>odum</i> wood and drink a pitcher of water.
If no ill effects ensue, he is deemed guilty, and is put to death;
while if he becomes sick, he is acquitted and the accuser
suffers in his stead.<a id="FNanchor_828_828" href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>Further to the east in the African continent, the Niam-Niam
and the neighboring tribes illustrate the endless variety of form
of which the ordeal is susceptible. These savages resort to
various kinds of divination which are equally employed as a
guidance for the future in all important undertakings, and as
means to discover the guilt or the innocence of those accused
of crime. The principal of these is the <i>borru</i>, in which two
polished pieces of damma wood are rubbed together, after
being moistened with a few drops of water. If they glide
easily on each other the sign is favorable; if they adhere
together it is unfavorable. Life and death are also brought
in play, but vicarious victims are made the subject of experiment.
Thus a cock is taken and its head is repeatedly immersed
in water until the creature is rigid and insensible; if it recovers,
the indication is favorable, if it dies, adverse. Or an oil extracted
from the bengye wood is administered to a hen, and
the same conclusions are drawn from its survival or death.<a id="FNanchor_829_829" href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a></p>

<p>The Somali of Ethiopia employ the ordeals of red-hot iron
and boiling water or oil in virtually the same form as we shall
see them used in India and Europe, examining the hand of
the accused after twenty-four hours to determine his guilt from
its condition.<a id="FNanchor_830_830" href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a></p>

<p>In Madagascar the poison ordeal is customarily administered,
with a decoction of the deadly nut of the Tangena
(<i>Tanghinia venenifera</i>). One of the modes of its application
is evidently based on the same theory as the ordeal of red
water and rice, to which it bears a notable resemblance. A
fowl is boiled, and three pieces of its skin are placed in the
broth. Then a cupful of the decoction of the Tangena nut
is given to the accused, followed by the same quantity of the
broth, with the pieces of skin. Unless the poison speedily
causes vomiting, it soon kills the patient, which is a satisfactory
proof of his guilt. If vomiting ensues, it is kept up by
repeated doses of the broth and warm water, and if the bits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
of skin are ejected the accused is declared innocent; but if
they are retained he is deemed convicted and is summarily
despatched with another bowl of the poison. In the persecutions
of 1836 and 1849 directed against the Malagasy
Christians, many of the converts were tried with the Tangena
nut, and numbers of them perished.<a id="FNanchor_831_831" href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> The ordeals of red-hot
iron and boiling water are also used.<a id="FNanchor_832_832" href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></p>

<p>Springing from the same belief is the process used in Tahiti
for discovering the criminal in cases of theft. The priest,
when applied to, digs a hole in the clay floor of his hut, fills
it with water, and stands over it with a young plantain in his
hand, while invoking his god. The deity thereupon conducts
the spirit of the thief over the water, and his reflection is recognized
by the priest.<a id="FNanchor_833_833" href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a></p>

<p>The races of the Indian archipelago are fully equipped with
resources of the same kind for settling doubtful cases. Among
the Dyaks of Borneo questions for which no other solution is
apparent are settled by giving to each litigant a lump of salt,
which they drop simultaneously into water, and he whose lump
dissolves soonest is adjudged the loser; or each takes a living
shell and places it on a plate, when lime-juice is squeezed over
them, and the one whose shell first moves under this gentle
stimulant is declared the winner.<a id="FNanchor_834_834" href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></p>

<p>In the Philippines there are various peculiar ordeals in use.
A needle is sometimes thrust into the scalp of two antagonists,
and he from whom the blood flows most profusely is adjudged
the loser; or two chickens are roasted to death and then
opened, and the owner of the one which is found to have the
largest liver is defeated.<a id="FNanchor_835_835" href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>The black Australioid Khonds of the hill districts of Orissa
confirm the universality of these practices by customs peculiar
to themselves which may be assumed as handed down by tradition
from prehistoric times. Not only do they constantly employ
the ordeals of boiling water and oil and red-hot iron, which
they may have borrowed from their Hindu neighbors, but they
administer judicial oaths with imprecations that are decidedly
of the character of ordeals. Thus an oath is taken on a tiger’s
skin with an invocation of destruction from that animal upon
the perjured; or upon a lizard’s skin whose scaliness is invited
upon him who may forswear himself; or over an ant-hill with
an imprecation that he who swears falsely may be reduced
to powder. A more characteristic ordeal is that used in litigation
concerning land, when a portion of earth from the disputed
possession is swallowed by each claimant in the belief
that it will destroy him whose pretensions are false. On very
solemn occasions a sheep is killed in the name of Tari Pennu,
the dreadful earth-goddess: rice is then moistened with its
blood, and this is administered, in the full conviction that she
will slay the rash litigant who insults her power by perjury.<a id="FNanchor_836_836" href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></p>

<p>The hill-tribes of Rajmahal, who represent another of the
pre-Aryan Indian races, furnish us with further developments
of the same principle, in details bearing a marked analogy to
those practised by the most diverse families of mankind.
Thus the process by which the guilt of Achan was discovered
(<i>Joshua</i> vii. 16-18), and that by which, as we shall see hereafter,
Master Anselm proposed to identify the thief of the
sacred vessels of Laon, are not unlike the ceremony used
when a district is ravaged by tigers or by pestilence, which
is regarded as a retribution for sin committed by some inhabitant,
whose identification thus becomes all-important for the
salvation of the rest. In the process known as <i>Satane</i> a person
sits on the ground with a branch of the bale tree planted
opposite to him; rice is handed to him to eat in the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
each village of the district, and when the one is named in
which the culprit lives, he is expected to throw up the rice.
Having thus determined the village, the same plan is adopted
with respect to each family in it, and when the family is identified,
the individual is discovered in the same manner.
Another form, named <i>Cherreen</i>, is not unlike the ordeal of
the Bible and key, not as yet obsolete among Christians. A
stone is suspended by a string, and the names of the villages,
families, and individuals are repeated, when it indicates the
guilty by its vibrations. Thieves are also discovered and convicted
by these processes, and by another mode known as
<i>Gobereen</i>, which is a modification of the hot-water ordeal. A
mixture of cow-dung, oil, and water is made to boil briskly in
a pot. A ring is thrown in, and each suspected person, after
invoking the Supreme Deity, is required to find and bring out
the ring with his hand—the belief being that the innocent will
not be burned, while the guilty will not be able to put his hand
into the pot, as the mixture will rise up to meet it.<a id="FNanchor_837_837" href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient Aztecs the oath assumed the proportions
of an ordeal; the accused in taking it touched with his finger
first the ground and then his tongue, and a perjury thus committed
was expected to be followed with speedy misfortune.
So among the Ostiaks and Samoiedes a disculpatory oath with
imprecations taken on the head of a bear is held to have the
same virtue.<a id="FNanchor_838_838" href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reverting to the older races, we find no trace of formal
ordeals in the fragmentary remains out of which Egyptologists
thus far have succeeded in reconstructing the antique civilization
of the Nile valley, but this is not attributable to an intellectual
development which had cast them aside as worthless.
The intimate dependence of man on the gods, and the daily
interposition of the latter in human affairs, were taught by the
prophets of the temples and reverently accepted by the people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
It was merely a question as to the manner in which the judgment
of God was to be obtained, and this apparently took the
form of reference to the oracles which abounded in every
Egyptian nome. In this we are not left to mere conjecture, for
a story related by Herodotus shows that such an interpellation
of the divine power was habitual in prosecutions when evidence
of guilt was deficient. Aames II., before he gained the
crown, was noted for his reckless and dissolute life, and was
frequently accused of theft and carried to the nearest oracle,
when he was convicted or acquitted according to the response.
On ascending the throne, he paid great respect to the shrines
where he had been condemned, and neglected altogether those
where he had been absolved, saying that the former gave true
and the latter lying responses.<a id="FNanchor_839_839" href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Semitic races, while not giving to the ordeal the development
which it has received among the Aryans, still afford
sufficient manifestation of its existence among them. Chaldean
and Assyrian institutions have not as yet been sufficiently
explored for us to state with positiveness whether or not the
judgment of God was a recognized resource of the puzzled
dispenser of justice; but the probabilities are strongly in favor
of some processes of the kind being discovered when we are
more fully acquainted with their judicial system. The constant
invocation of the gods, which forms so marked a feature
of the cuneiform inscriptions, indicates a belief in the divine
guidance of human affairs which could hardly fail to find expression
in direct appeals for light in the administration of
justice. The nearest approach however to the principle of the
ordeal which has thus far been deciphered is found in the
imprecations commonly expressed in contracts, donations, and
deeds, by which the gods are invoked to shed all the curses
that can assail humanity on the heads of those who shall evade
the execution of their plighted faith, or seek to present false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
claims. Akin to this, moreover, was the penalty frequently
expressed in contracts whereby their violation was to be
punished by heavy fines, the greater part of which was payable
into the treasury of some temple.<a id="FNanchor_840_840" href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a></p>

<p>Among the Hebrews, as a rule, the interposition of Yahveh
was expected directly, without the formulas which human
ingenuity has invented to invite and ascertain the decisions of
the divine will. Still, the combat of David and Goliath has
been cited as a model and justification of the judicial duel;
and there are some practices described in Scripture which are
strictly ordeals, and which were duly put forth by the local
clergy throughout Europe when struggling to defend the
system against the prohibitions of the papacy. When the man
who blasphemed the Lord (<i>Levit.</i> xxiv. 11-16) was kept in
ward “that the mind of the Lord might be showed them,”
and the Lord ordered Moses to have him stoned by the whole
congregation, we are not told the exact means adopted to
ascertain the will of Yahveh, but the appeal was identical in
principle with that which prompted the mediæval judgment of
God. The use of the lot, moreover, which was so constantly
employed in the most important and sacred matters, was not a
mere appeal to chance, but was a sacred ceremony performed
“before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation”
to learn what was the decision of Yahveh.<a id="FNanchor_841_841" href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> The lot
was also used, if not as a regular judicial expedient, at all
events in unusual cases as a mode of discovering criminals,
and its results were held to be the undoubted revelation of
Omniscience. It is more than probable that the Urim and
Thummin were lots, and that they were not infrequently used,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
as in the cases of Achan and Jonathan.<a id="FNanchor_842_842" href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> And the popular
belief in the efficacy of the lot is manifested in the account of
Jonah’s adventure (<i>Jonah</i> i. 7) when the sailors are described
as casting lots to discover the sinner whose presence brought
the tempest upon them. The most formal and absolute
example of the ordeal, however, was the Bitter Water by
which conjugal infidelity was convicted and punished (<i>Numb.</i>
v. 11-31). This curious and elaborate ceremony, which
bears so marked an analogy to the poison ordeals, was abandoned
by order of R. Johanan ben Saccai about the time of
the Christian era, and is too well known to require more than
a passing allusion to the wealth of Haggadistic legend and
the interminable controversies and speculations to which it
has given rise. I may add, however, that Aben Ezra and
other Jewish commentators hold that when Moses burnt the
golden calf and made the Israelites drink the water in which
its ashes were cast (<i>Exod.</i> xxxii. 20), he administered an
ordeal, like that of the Bitter Water, which in some way revealed
those who had been guilty of idolatry, so that the
Levites could slay them; and Selden explains this by reference
to a tradition, according to which the gold of the calf
reddened the beards of those who had worshipped it, and
thus rendered them conspicuous.<a id="FNanchor_843_843" href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The teachings of Mahomet were too directly derived from
the later Judaism for him to admit into his jurisprudence any
formal system depending on miracles to establish justice between
man and man whenever Allah might be invoked to
manifest his power. Like the Jews, however, he taught that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the constant supervision of the divine power is spontaneously
exerted, and he carried this so far as to inculcate the belief
that a judge pure from self-seeking would be inspired constantly
from above. “He who asks to be made judge will
not be assisted; and he who is made judge by compulsion,
God sends down to him an angel, who causes his actions and
sentences to be just.” To one who hesitated to accept the
office, the Prophet said, “God will direct your heart, and
show you judicial ways, and fix your tongue in truth and
justice.” On the other hand, when a judge is unjust, “he
separates from himself the assistance and favor of God, and
the devil is always with him.” It was hard on litigants when
the tribunal might be presided over by either Allah or Eblis,
but they had no recourse, except in the oath, which was the
corner-stone of Mahomet’s judicial system. In the absence of
evidence, the oath of the defendant was final, and this incitement
to perjury could only be repressed by investing the oath
with the qualities of the ordeal. Accordingly he lost no
opportunity of insisting upon the punishment, here and hereafter,
of those who perjured themselves before the judgment-seat.
Sometimes this failed to deter an eager pleader, and
then he consoled the defeated party with the assurance that
his successful adversary would suffer in the end, as when the
chief of the Cindah tribe urged that a Jew, against whom he
brought suit for land unjustly held, would swear falsely, and
the Prophet rejoined, “Swearing is lawful, but he who takes
a false oath will have no luck in futurity.” Tradition relates,
however, that frequently he succeeded thus in frightening
those who were ready to forswear themselves, as when a man
of Hadramut claimed land occupied by a Cindah, and, being
without evidence, the defendant was ready to take the oath,
when Mahomet interposed, “No one takes the property of
another by oath but will meet God with his tongue cut off,”
and the Cindah feared God and said, “The land is his.” In
another case, when two men were quarrelling over an inheritance,
and neither had a witness, he warned them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> “In whose
favor soever I may order a thing which is not his right, then
I lay apart for him nothing less than a piece of hell-fire,”
whereupon each litigant exclaimed, “O messenger of God,
I give up my right to him.” Sometimes, however, even
Mahomet had recourse to a more direct invocation of the
supreme power, as in a case wherein two men disputed as to
the ownership of an animal, and neither had witnesses, when
he directed them to cast lots upon oath.<a id="FNanchor_844_844" href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a></p>

<p>These cases do not bear out the tradition that, when the
Prophet was perplexed beyond his ability, he had the resource
of appealing to the angel Gabriel for enlightenment. There
is one legend respecting him, however, which manifests the
popular belief that in doubtful cases God may be relied on to
interpose for the vindication of innocence. A youth brought
before Mahomet on an accusation of murder, protested that
the act was committed in self-defence. The Prophet ordered
the corpse to be entombed, and postponed the trial until the
next day. The brethren of the slain, still insisting on vengeance,
were then told that they might inflict upon the
murderer precisely the same wounds as those which they
should find on the body. On opening the sepulchre for the
purpose of ascertaining the exact measure of the punishment
conceded, they returned affrighted to the judgment-seat, and
reported that they had found nothing but the smoke and stench
of Gehenna; whereupon Mahomet pronounced that Eblis had
carried off the corpse of the guilty, and that the accused was
innocent.<a id="FNanchor_845_845" href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> The prevalence of superstitions kindred to this, in
spite of the principles laid down in the law, is shown by the
custom which exists among some tribes of Arabs, of employing
the ordeal of red-hot iron in the shape of a gigantic spoon,
to which, when duly heated, the accused applies his tongue,
his guilt or innocence being manifested by his suffering, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
escaping injury.<a id="FNanchor_846_846" href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> A species of vulgar divination, common
among the Turks, moreover, belongs to the same category of
thought, as it is used in the detection of thieves by observing
the marks on wax slowly melted, while certain magic formulas
are recited over it.<a id="FNanchor_847_847" href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is among the Aryan races that we are to look for the
fullest and most enduring evidences of the beliefs which developed
into the ordeal, and gave it currency from the rudest
stages of nomadic existence to periods of polished and enlightened
civilization. In the perfect dualism of Mazdeism,
the Yazatas, or angels of the good creation, were always
prompt to help the pure and innocent against the machinations
of Ahriman and his Daevas, their power to do so depending
only upon the righteousness of him who needed
assistance.<a id="FNanchor_848_848" href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> The man unjustly accused, or seeking to obtain
or defend his right, could therefore safely trust that any trial
to which he might be subjected would be harmless, however
much the ordinary course of nature would have to be turned
aside in order to save him. Thus Zoroaster could readily explain
and maintain the ancestral practices, the common use of
which by both the Zend and the Hindu branches of the Aryan
family points to their origin at a period anterior to the separation
between the kindred tribes. In the fragments of the
Avesta, which embody what remains to us of the prehistoric
law of the ancient Persians, we find a reference to the ordeal
of boiling water, showing it to be an accepted legal process,
with a definite penalty affixed for him who failed to exculpate
himself in it:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Creator! he who knowingly approaches the hot, golden,
boiling water, as if speaking truth, but lying to Mithra;</p>

<p>“What is the punishment for it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>“Then answered Ahura-Mazda: Let them strike seven
hundred blows with the horse-goad, seven hundred with the
craosho-charana!”<a id="FNanchor_849_849" href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The fire ordeal is also seen in the legend which relates how
Sudabeh, the favorite wife of Kai Kaoos, became enamored
of his son Siawush, and on his rejecting her advances accused
him to his father of endeavoring to seduce her. Kai Kaoos
sent out a hundred caravans of dromedaries to gather wood,
of which two immense piles were built separated by a passage
barely admitting a horseman. These were soaked with naphtha
and fired in a hundred places, when Siawush mounted on
a charger, after an invocation to God, rode through the flames
and emerged without even a discoloration of his garments.
Sudabeh was sentenced to death, but pardoned on the intercession
of Siawush.<a id="FNanchor_850_850" href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> Another reminiscence of the same ordeal
may be traced among the crowd of fantastic legends with
which the career of Zoroaster is embroidered. It is related
that when an infant he was seized by the magicians, who foresaw
their future destruction at his hands, and was thrown upon
a huge pile composed of wood, naphtha, and sulphur, which
was forthwith kindled; but, through the interposition of Hormazd,
“the devouring flame became as water, in the midst of
which slumbered the pearl of Zardusht.”<a id="FNanchor_851_851" href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a></p>

<p>In Pehlvi the judicial ordeal was known as <i>var nirang</i>, and
thirty-three doubtful conjunctures are enumerated as requiring
its employment. The ordinary form was the pouring of molten
metal on the body of the patient, though sometimes the
heated substance was applied to the tongue or the feet.<a id="FNanchor_852_852" href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
the former, a celebrated instance, curiously anticipating the
story told, as we shall see hereafter, of Bishop Poppo when he
converted the Danes, is related as a leading incident in the
reformation of the Mazdiasni religion when the Persian monarchy
was reconstructed by the Sassanids. Eighty thousand
heretics remained obstinate until Sapor I. was so urgent with
his Magi to procure their conversion that the Dustoor Adurabad
offered to prove the truth of orthodoxy by suffering
eighteen pounds of melted copper to be poured over his naked
shoulders if the dissenters would agree to yield their convictions
in case he escaped unhurt. The bargain was agreed to,
and carried out with the happiest results. Not a hair of the
Dustoor’s body was singed by the rivulets of fiery metal, and
the recusants were gathered into the fold.<a id="FNanchor_853_853" href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a></p>

<p>Among the Hindu Aryans so thoroughly was the divine
interposition expected in the affairs of daily life that, according
to the Manava Dharma Sastra, if a witness, within a week
after giving testimony, should suffer from sickness, or undergo
loss by fire, or the death of a relation, it was held to be a
manifestation of the divine wrath, drawn down upon him in
punishment for perjured testimony.<a id="FNanchor_854_854" href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> There was, therefore, no
inducement to abandon the resource of the ordeal, of which
traces may be found as far back as the Vedic period, in the
forms both of fire and red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_855_855" href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> In the Ramayana, when
Rama, the incarnate Vishnu, distrusts the purity of his beloved
Sita, whom he has rescued from the Rakshasha Ravana, she
vindicates herself by mounting a blazing pyre, from which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
is rescued unhurt by the fire-god, Agni, himself.<a id="FNanchor_856_856" href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> Manu declares,
in the most absolute fashion—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let the judge cause him who is under trial to take fire in
his hand, or to plunge in water, or to touch separately the
heads of his children and of his wife.</p>

<p>“Whom the flame burneth not, whom the water rejects not
from its depths, whom misfortune overtakes not speedily, his
oath shall be received as undoubted.</p>

<p>“When the Rishi Vatsa was accused by his young half-brother,
who stigmatized him as the son of a Sudra, he swore
that it was false, and, passing through fire, proved the truth
of his oath; the fire, which attests the guilt and the innocence
of all men, harmed not a hair of his head, for he spake the
truth.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And the practical application of the rule is seen in the injunction
on both plaintiff and defendant to undergo the ordeal,
even in certain civil cases.<a id="FNanchor_857_857" href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></p>

<p>In the more developed code of Vishnu we find the ordeal
system exceedingly complicated, pervading every branch of
jurisprudence and only limited by the amount at stake or the
character or caste of the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_858_858" href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> Yet Hindu antiquity
is so remote and there have been so many schools of teachers
that the custom apparently did not prevail in all times and
places. One of the most ancient books of law is the Dharmasastra
of Gautama, who says nothing of ordeals and relies
for proof wholly on the evidence of witnesses, adding the very
relaxed rule that “No guilt is incurred in giving false evidence
in case the life of a man depends thereon.”<a id="FNanchor_859_859" href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a></p>

<p>This, however, is exceptional, and the ordeal maintained its
existence from the most ancient periods to modern times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Under the name of <i>purrikeh</i>, or <i>parikyah</i>, it is prescribed in
the native Hindu law in all cases, civil and criminal, which
cannot be determined by written or oral evidence, or by oath,
and is sometimes incumbent upon the plaintiff and sometimes
upon the defendant. In its various forms it bears so marked
a resemblance to the judgments of God current in mediæval
Europe that the further consideration of its use in India may
be more conveniently deferred till we come to discuss its varieties
in detail, except to add that in Hindu, as in Christian
courts, it has always been a religious as well as a judicial ceremony,
conducted in the presence of Brahmans, and with the
use of invocations to the higher powers.<a id="FNanchor_860_860" href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Buddhism naturally followed the legal institutions which it
found established, and accepted the ordeal, though it could
scarce form a logical incident in the great system of transmigration
whereby the good and evil of the universe distributed
itself automatically, without supervision from the
thirty-two heavens. We have seen the influence which Buddhism
exercised on Chinese materialism, and Tibetan Shamanism
could hardly expect to escape it. Thus in Tibet we
find the hot water ordeal assume a form which is literally even-handed,
and which, if generally enforced, must exert a happily
repressive influence over litigation. Both plaintiff and
defendant thrust their arms into a caldron of boiling water
containing a black and a white stone, the verdict being in
favor of him who brings up the white.<a id="FNanchor_861_861" href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Hellenic tribes had already, in prehistoric times,
reached a point of mental development superior to the grosser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
forms of the ordeal as a recognized instrument of judicial investigation.
These were replaced, as we have seen in Egypt,
by habitual resort to oracles, but that some recollection of the
ancestral practices was handed down to later ages is shown by
the allusions in the Antigone of Sophocles, when the guards
protest to Creon their innocence as to the burial of Polynices,
and offer to prove it by the ordeal:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ready with hands to bear the red-hot iron,</div>
<div class="verse">To pass through fire, and by the gods to swear</div>
<div class="verse">That we nor did the deed, nor do we know</div>
<div class="verse">Who counselled it, or who performed it” (264-267).</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And a remnant of the primæval customs was preserved in the
solemnities under which litigation was sometimes determined
by one of the parties taking an oath on the heads of his children,
or with curses on himself and his family, or passing
through fire.<a id="FNanchor_862_862" href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> The poison ordeal, also, was not wholly obsolete.
The Gæum or temple of the broad-breasted Earth, Gæa
Eurysternus, at Ægæ in Achaia, was served by a priestess
who, though not necessarily a virgin, was yet required to preserve
strict celibacy when once invested with her sacred functions.
If any doubts arose as to her virtue, it was tested with
a draught of bull’s blood, which speedily wrought her punishment
if she was guilty. The same temple also furnished
an illustration of ascertaining the divine will by means of the
lot, for when a vacancy occurred in the priestship, and there
were several applicants, the choice between them was determined
by a reference to chance.<a id="FNanchor_863_863" href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a></p>

<p>Even these traces of the ancient customs of the race disappear
among the Latins, though they preserved in full force the
habits of thought from which the ordeal took its rise. This is
seen in the most solemn form of imprecation known to the
Romans as lending irrevocable force to promissory oaths—the
“Jovem lapidem jurare,”—whether we take the ceremony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
mentioned by Festus, of casting a stone from the hand while
adjuring Jupiter to reject in like manner the swearer if he
should prove forsworn, or the form described by Livy as preceding
the combat between the Horatii and Curiatii, in which
a victim was knocked on the head with a stone under a somewhat
similar invocation.<a id="FNanchor_864_864" href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> Even without this ceremony, imprecatory
oaths were used which were based on the belief that
the gods would take men at their word and punish them, for
forswearing themselves, with the evils which they thus invoked.
Thus, after the battle of Cannæ, P. Cornelius Scipio forced
the nobles who were plotting to leave Italy to abandon their
design and take an oath in which they adjured Jupiter to visit
them and all belonging to them with the worst of deaths if
they proved false.<a id="FNanchor_865_865" href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> In the legends of Rome, moreover,
sporadic instances may be found of special miraculous interposition
to decide the question of innocence or guilt, when the
gods properly appealed to would intervene to save their worshippers.
These manifestations were principally vouchsafed
in favor of the Vestals, as when the pupil of Æmilia was
accused of having allowed the sacred fire to be extinguished,
and was preserved by its spontaneous ignition on her placing
the skirt of her garment upon the altar; or when Tucca,
falsely arraigned for unchastity, vindicated her purity by carrying
water in a sieve; or when Claudia Quinta, under a
similar charge, made good her defence by dragging, with a
slender cord, a ship against the rapid current of the Tiber
after it had run aground and resisted all efforts to move it—and
this with an invocation to the goddess to absolve or condemn
her, as she was innocent or guilty, which gives to the
affair a marked resemblance to an established form of judicial
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_866_866" href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> Occasional instances such as these had, however, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
influence on the forms and principles of Roman jurisprudence,
which was based on reason and not on superstition. With the
exception of the use of torture, as we shall see hereafter, the
accused was not required to exculpate himself. He was presumed
to be innocent, and the burden of proof lay not on him
but on the prosecutor. The maxim of the civil law—“Accusatore
non probante, reus absolvitur”—is entirely incompatible
with the whole theory upon which the system of ordeals
is based.<a id="FNanchor_867_867" href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The barbarian Aryans who occupied Europe brought with
them the ancestral beliefs in a form more easily recognizable
than the remnants which survived through Hellenic and Italiote
civilization. The Feini, or Irish Celts, boasted that their
ancient Brehons, or judges, were warned by supernatural manifestations
as to the equity of the judgments which they rendered.
Sometimes these took the shape of blotches on their
cheeks when they pronounced false judgments. Sen Mac Aige
was subject to these marks, but with him they disappeared when
he decided righteously, while Sencha Mac Aillila was less fortunate,
for he was visited with three permanent blotches for
each mistake. Fachtna received the surname of Tulbrethach
because, whenever he delivered a false judgment, “if in the
time of fruit, all the fruit in the territory in which it happened
fell off in one night; if in time of milk, the cows refused their
calves; but if he passed a true judgment, the fruit was perfect
on the trees.” Morann never pronounced a judgment without
wearing around his neck a chain, which tightened upon him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
if the judgment was false, but expanded down upon him if it
were true. These quaint legends have their interest as manifesting
the importance attached by the ancient Irish to the
impartial administration of absolute justice, and the belief
entertained that a supernatural power was ever on the watch
over the tribunals, but these manifestations were too late to
arrest injustice, as they did not occur until after it was committed.
The Feini therefore did not abandon the ancient
resource of the ordeal, as is shown by a provision in the
Senchus Mor, which grants a delay of ten days to a man
obliged to undergo the test of boiling water.<a id="FNanchor_868_868" href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> The Celts of
the Rhinelands also had a local custom of determining the
legitimacy of children by an ordeal of the purest chance,
which became a common-place of Roman rhetoric, and is
thus described in the Anthology:—</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>
<p>The Teutonic tribes, anterior to their conversion, likewise
exhibit the ordeal as a recognized resource in judicial proceedings.
The Norræna branch, as we have seen, cultivated
the <i>holm-gang</i>, or duel, with ardor, and they likewise employed
the hot-water ordeal, besides a milder form peculiar to
themselves entitled the <i>skirsla</i>, in which one of the parties to
a suit could prove the truth of his oath by passing under a
strip of turf raised so that it formed an arch with each end
resting on the ground, the belief being that if he had forsworn
himself the turf would fall on him as he passed beneath
it.<a id="FNanchor_870_870" href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> The Germanic tribes, in their earliest jurisprudence,
afford similar evidence of adherence to the customs of their
eastern brethren. The most ancient extant recension of the
Salic law may safely be assumed as coeval with the conversion
of Clovis, as it is free from all allusions to Christian rules,
such as appear in the later versions, and in this the trial by
boiling water finds its place as a judicial process in regular
use.<a id="FNanchor_871_871" href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> Among the Bavarians, the decree of Duke Tassilo in
772 condemns as a relic of pagan rites a custom named
<i>stapfsaken</i>, used in cases of disputed debt, which is evidently
a kind of ordeal from the formula employed, “Let us stretch
forth our right hands to the just judgment of God!”<a id="FNanchor_872_872" href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a></p>

<p>The Slavs equally bear witness to the ancestral practice of
the ordeal as a judicial process. The <i>prauda jeliezo</i>, or hot-iron
ordeal, was in use among them in early times.<a id="FNanchor_873_873" href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> In Bohemia,
the laws of Brzetislas, promulgated in 1039, make no allusion
to any other form of evidence in contested cases, while in
Russia it was the final resort in all prosecutions for murder,
theft, and false accusation.<a id="FNanchor_874_874" href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>As the Barbarians established themselves on the ruins of the
Roman Empire and embraced Christianity they, with one exception,
cultivated the institution of the ordeal with increased
ardor. This exception is found in the Gothic nations, and is
ascribable, as we have seen when treating of the judicial combat,
to the influence of the Roman customs and laws which
they adopted. For nearly two centuries after their settlement,
there is no allusion in their body of laws to any form of ordeal.
It was not until 693, long after the destruction of their supremacy
in the south of France, and but little prior to their overthrow
in Spain by the Saracens, that King Egiza, with the sanction
of a Council of Toledo, issued an edict commanding the employment
of the <i>æneum</i> or ordeal of boiling water.<a id="FNanchor_875_875" href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a></p>

<p>Various causes were at work among the other tribes to
stimulate the favor with which the ordeal was regarded. As
respects the wager of battle I have already traced its career
as a peculiarly European form of the Judgment of God,
which was fostered by the advantage which it gave, in the
times of nascent feudalism, to the bold and reckless. With
regard to the other forms, one reason for their increased prevalence
is doubtless to be found in the universal principle of
the Barbarians, in their successive settlements, to allow all
races to retain their own jurisprudence, however much individuals
might be intermingled, socially and politically. The
confusion to which this gave birth is well set forth by St.
Agobard, when he remarks that frequently five men shall be
found in close companionship, each one owning obedience to
a different law. He also states that under the Burgundian
rules of procedure, no one was allowed to bear witness against
a man of different race.<a id="FNanchor_876_876" href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> Under these circumstances, in a
large proportion of cases there could be no legal evidence attainable,
and recourse was had of necessity to the Judgment
of God. Even when this rule was not in force, a man who
appealed to Heaven against the testimony of a witness of dif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>ferent
origin would be apt to find the court disposed to grant
his request. If the judge, moreover, was a compatriot of one
of the pleaders, the other would naturally distrust his impartiality,
and would prefer to have the case decided by the
Omniscient whose direct interposition he was taught to regard
as undoubted. That the assumed fairness of the ordeal was
highly prized under such circumstances we have evidence in
the provisions of a treaty between the Welsh and the Saxons,
about the year 1000, according to which all questions between
individuals of the two races were to be settled in this manner,
in the absence of a special agreement between the parties.<a id="FNanchor_877_877" href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a></p>

<p>The most efficient cause of the increased use of the ordeal
was, however, to be found in the Church. With her customary
tact, in converting the Barbarians, she adopted such of their
customs as she could adapt to Christian belief and practice;
and she accepted the ordeal as an undoubted appeal to God,
whose response was regarded as unquestionable, warrant being
easily found for this in the Jewish practices already described.
The pagan ceremonies were moulded into Christian rites, and
the most solemn forms of religion were thrown around the rude
expedients invented thousands of years before by the Bactrian
nomads. Elaborate rituals were constructed, including celebration
of mass and impressive prayers, adjurations and exorcisms
of the person to undergo the trial and of the materials
used in it, and the most implicit faith was inculcated in the
interposition of God to defend the right and to punish guilt.<a id="FNanchor_878_878" href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a>
The administration of the ordeal being thus reserved for
priestly hands, the Church acquired a vastly increased influence
as the minister of justice, to say nothing of the revenues thence
arising, and the facility with which ecclesiastics could thus
defend themselves when legally assailed by their turbulent
flocks. We are not without evidence of the manner in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the church thus favored the use of this Christianized paganism,
and introduced it along with Christianity among people to
whom it was previously unknown. Thus among the Turanian
Majjars, the laws of King Stephen, promulgated in 1216, soon
after his conversion, contain no allusion to the ordeal, but in
those of Ladislas and Coloman, issued towards the end of the
century, it is found, in its various forms, thoroughly established
as a means of legal proof.<a id="FNanchor_879_879" href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> So, when in the twelfth century
Bishop Geroldus converted the Slavs of Mecklenburg, they
were at once forbidden to settle questions by oaths taken on
trees, fountains, and stones, as before, but were required to
bring their criminals before the priest to be tried by the hot
iron or ploughshares.<a id="FNanchor_880_880" href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> Under the Crusaders, the ordeal was
carried back towards the home of its birth, even contaminating
the Byzantine civilization, and various instances of its use are
related by the historians of the Lower Empire to a period as
late as the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of the church and the superstition of the
people increased somewhat the varieties of the ordeal which
we have seen employed in the East. Besides the judicial
combat, the modes by which the will of Heaven was ascertained
may be classed as the ordeal of boiling water, of red-hot
iron, of fire, of cold water, of the balance, of the cross, of
the <i>corsnœd</i> or swallowing bread or cheese, of the Eucharist,
of the lot, bier-right, oaths on relics, and poison ordeals. In
some of these, it will be seen, a miraculous interposition was
required for an acquittal, in others for a condemnation; some
depended altogether on volition, others on the purest chance;
while others, again, derived their efficacy from the influence
exerted over the mind of the patient.</p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF BOILING WATER.</small></h3>


<p>The ordeal of boiling water (<i>æneum, judicium aquæ ferventis,
cacabus, caldaria</i>) is the one usually referred to in the
most ancient texts of laws. It was a favorite both with the
secular and ecclesiastical authorities, and the manner in which
the pagan usages of the ancient Aryans were adopted and
rendered orthodox by the Church is well illustrated by the
commendation bestowed on it by Hincmar, Archbishop of
Reims, in the ninth century. It combines, he says, the
elements of water and of fire; the one representing the deluge—the
judgment inflicted on the wicked of old; the other
authorized by the fiery doom of the future—the day of judgment,
in both of which we see the righteous escape and the
wicked suffer.<a id="FNanchor_881_881" href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> There were several minor variations in its
administration, but none of them departed to any notable
extent from the original form as invented in the East. A
caldron of water was brought to the boiling-point, and the
accused was obliged with his naked hand to find a small stone
or ring thrown into it; sometimes the latter portion was
omitted, and the hand was simply inserted, in trivial cases to
the wrist, in crimes of magnitude to the elbow; the former
being termed the single, the latter the triple ordeal;<a id="FNanchor_882_882" href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> or, again,
the stone was employed, suspended by a string, and the
severity of the trial was regulated by the length of the line, a
palm’s breadth being counted as single, and the distance to the
elbow as triple.<a id="FNanchor_883_883" href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> A good example of the process, in all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
details, is furnished us by Gregory of Tours, who relates that
an Arian priest and a Catholic deacon, disputing about their
respective tenets, and being unable to convince each other,
the latter proposed to refer the subject to the decision of the
<i>æneum</i>, and the offer was accepted. Next morning the
deacon’s enthusiasm cooled, and he mingled his matins with
precautions of a less spiritual nature, by bathing his arm in
oil, and anointing it with protective unguents. The populace
assembled to witness the exhibition, the fire was lighted, the
caldron boiled furiously, and a little ring thrown into it was
whirled around like a straw in a tornado, when the deacon
politely invited his adversary to make the trial first. This
was declined, on the ground that precedence belonged to the
challenger, and with no little misgiving the deacon proceeded
to roll up his sleeve, when the Arian, observing the precautions
that had been taken, exclaimed that he had been using
magic arts, and that the trial would amount to nothing. At
this critical juncture, when the honor of the orthodox faith
was trembling in the balance, a stranger stepped forward—a
Catholic priest named Jacintus, from Ravenna—and offered
to undergo the experiment. Plunging his arm into the bubbling
caldron, he was two hours in capturing the ring, which
eluded his grasp in its fantastic gyrations; but finally, holding
it up in triumph to the admiring spectators, he declared
that the water felt cold at the bottom, with an agreeable
warmth at the top. Fired by the example, the unhappy
Arian boldly thrust in his arm; but the falseness of his cause
belied the confidence of its rash supporter, and in a moment
the flesh was boiled off the bones up to the elbow.<a id="FNanchor_884_884" href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a></p>

<p>This was a volunteer experiment. As a means of judicial
investigation, the Church, in adopting it with the other ordeals,
followed the policy of surrounding it with all the solemnity
which her most venerated rites could impart, thus imitating,
no doubt unconsciously, the customs of the Hindus, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
from the earliest times, have made the ordeal a religious ceremony,
to be conducted by Brahmans, with invocations to the
divine powers, and to be performed by the patient at sunrise,
immediately after the prescribed ablutions, and while yet fasting.<a id="FNanchor_885_885" href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a>
With the same object, in the European ordeal, fasting
and prayer were enjoined for three days previous, and the
ceremony commenced with special prayers and adjurations,
introduced for the purpose into the litany, and recited by the
officiating priests; mass was celebrated, and the accused was
required to partake of the sacrament under the fearful adjuration,
“This body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ be to
thee this day a manifestation!” This was followed by an exorcism
of the water, of which numerous formulas are on record,
varying in detail, but all manifesting the robust faith with
which man assumed to control the action of his Creator. A
single specimen will suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“O creature of water, I adjure thee by the living God, by
the holy God who in the beginning separated thee from the
dry land; I adjure thee by the living God who led thee from
the fountain of Paradise, and in four rivers commanded thee
to encompass the world; I adjure thee by Him who in Cana
of Galilee by His will changed thee to wine, who trod on thee
with His holy feet, who gave thee the name Siloa; I adjure
thee by the God who in thee cleansed Naaman, the Syrian, of
his leprosy;—saying, O holy water, O blessed water, water
which washest the dust and sins of the world, I adjure thee by
the living God that thou shalt show thyself pure, nor retain
any false image, but shalt be exorcised water, to make manifest
and reveal and bring to naught all falsehood, and to make manifest
and bring to light all truth; so that he who shall place
his hand in thee, if his cause be just and true, shall receive no
hurt; but if he be perjured, let his hand be burned with fire,
that all men may know the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who will come, with the Holy Ghost, to judge with fire the
quick and the dead, and the world! Amen!”<a id="FNanchor_886_886" href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After the hand had been plunged in the seething caldron,
it was carefully enveloped in a cloth, sealed with the signet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the judge, and three days afterwards it was unwrapped, when
the guilt or innocence of the party was announced by the condition
of the member.<a id="FNanchor_887_887" href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> By way of extra precaution, in some
rituals it is ordered that during this interval holy water and
blessed salt be mingled in all the food and drink of the patient—presumably
to avert diabolic interference with the result.<a id="FNanchor_888_888" href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a></p>

<p>The judicial use of this ordeal is shown in a charter of the
monastery of Sobrada in Galicia, when, about 987, the Bishop
of Lugo claimed of it for his church the manor of Villarplano.
After a vain effort to decide the question by evidence, the
representatives of the monastery took a solemn oath as to its
rights and offered to confirm it by the <i>pæna caldaria</i>. In the
church of San Juliano some fifty or sixty notables from both
sides assembled; a monk named Salamiro was conducted to
the boiling caldron by a person representing each claimant,
and there he drew forth ten stones from the bubbling water.
His arm was sealed up and three or four days later was exhibited
uninjured to the assembly. The proof was conclusive
and the Bishop of Lugo abandoned his claim.<a id="FNanchor_889_889" href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a></p>

<p>The justification of this mode of procedure by its most
able defender, Hincmar of Reims, is similar in spirit to
the above form of adjuration. King Lothair, great-grandson
of Charlemagne, desiring to get rid of his wife, Teutberga,
accused her of the foulest incest, and forced her to a confession,
which she afterwards recanted, proving her innocence by
undergoing the ordeal of hot water by proxy. Lothair, nevertheless,
married his concubine Waldrada, and for ten years
the whole of Europe was occupied with the degrading details
of the quarrel, council after council assembling to consider
the subject, and the thunders of Rome being freely employed.
Hincmar, the most conspicuous ecclesiastic of his day, stood
boldly forth in defence of the unhappy queen, and in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
treatise “De Divortio Lotharii et Teutbergæ,” although no
one at the time seriously thought of impugning the authority
of ordeals in general, it suited his purpose to insist upon their
claims to infallibility. His line of argument shows how thoroughly
the pagan custom had become Christianized, and how
easily the churchman could find reasons for attributing to God
the interposition which his ancestors had ascribed to Mithra,
or to Agni, or to Thor. “Because in boiling water the guilty
are scalded and the innocent are unhurt, because Lot escaped
unharmed from the fire of Sodom, and the future fire which
will precede the terrible Judge will be harmless to the Saints,
and will burn the wicked as in the Babylonian furnace of old.”<a id="FNanchor_890_890" href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a></p>

<p>In the Life of St. Ethelwold is recorded a miracle, which,
though not judicial, yet, from its description by a contemporary,
affords an insight into the credulous faith which rendered
lawgivers ready to intrust the most important interests
to decisions of this nature. The holy saint, while Abbot of
Abingdon, to test the obedience of Elfstan the cook of the
monastery, ordered him to extract with his hand a piece of
meat from the bottom of a caldron in which the conventual
dinner was boiling. Without hesitation the monk plunged
his hand into the seething mass and unhurt presented the
desired morsel to his wondering superior. Faith such as this
could not go unrewarded, and Elfstan, from his humble station,
rose to the episcopal seat of Winchester.<a id="FNanchor_891_891" href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></p>

<p>This form of trial was in use among all the races in whose
legislation the <i>purgatio vulgaris</i> found place. It is the only
mode alluded to in the Salic Law, from the primitive text to
the amended code of Charlemagne.<a id="FNanchor_892_892" href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> The same may be said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of the Wisigoths, as we have already seen; while the codes of
the Frisians, the Anglo-Saxons, and the Lombards, all refer
cases to its decision.<a id="FNanchor_893_893" href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> In Iceland, it was employed from the
earliest times;<a id="FNanchor_894_894" href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> in the primitive jurisprudence of Russia its
use was enjoined in cases of minor importance,<a id="FNanchor_895_895" href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> and it continued
in vogue throughout Europe until the general discredit
attached to this mode of judgment led to the gradual abandonment
of the ordeal as a legal process. It is among the
forms enumerated in the sweeping condemnation of the whole
system, in 1215, by Innocent III. in the Fourth Council of
Lateran; but even subsequently we find it prescribed in certain
cases by the municipal laws in force throughout the whole of
Northern and Southern Germany,<a id="FNanchor_896_896" href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> and as late as 1282 it is
specified in a charter of Gaston of Béarn, conferring on a
church the privilege of holding ordeals.<a id="FNanchor_897_897" href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> At a later date,
indeed, it was sometimes administered in a different and more
serious form, the accused being expected to swallow the boiling
water. I have met with no instances recorded of this, but
repeated allusions to it by Rickius show that it could not have
been unusual.<a id="FNanchor_898_898" href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> Another variant is seen in the case of a monk
who had brought the body of St. Helena to his convent and
was forced to prove its genuineness by complete immersion in
boiling water—a trial which he endured successfully.<a id="FNanchor_899_899" href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></p>

<p>The modern Hindoo variety of this ordeal consists in casting
a piece of gold or a metal ring into a vessel of boiling
<i>ghee</i>, or sesame oil, of a specified size and depth. Sacrifices
are offered to the gods, a mantra, or Vedic prayer, is uttered
over the oil, which is heated until it burns a fresh peepul leaf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
and if the person on trial can extract the ring between his
finger and thumb, without scalding himself, he is pronounced
victorious.<a id="FNanchor_900_900" href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> In 1783 a case is recorded as occurring at
Benares, in which a Brahman accused a linen-painter of theft,
and as there was no other way of settling the dispute, both
parties agreed to abide by the result of the ordeal. At that
time the East India Company was endeavoring to discountenance
this superstition, but could not venture to abolish
it forcibly, and as persuasion was unavailing the accused was
allowed to undergo the experiment, which resulted in his conviction.
Not much confidence, however, seems to have been
felt in the trial, as the fine incurred by him was not enforced.<a id="FNanchor_901_901" href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a>
Of course, under the influence of English rule, this and all
other ordeals are legally obsolete, but the popular belief in
them is not easily eradicated. So lately as 1867 the Bombay
<i>Gazette</i> records a case occurring at Jamnuggur, when a camel-driver
named Chakee Soomar, under whose charge a considerable
sum of money was lost, was exposed by a local official to
the ordeal of boiling oil. The authorities, however, took
prompt measures to punish this act of cruelty. The <i>karb-haree</i>
who ordered it escaped chastisement by opportunely
dying, but the owner of the treasure, who had urged the trial,
was condemned to pay to the camel-driver a pension of 100 rupees
during life. In 1868 the Madras <i>Times</i> chronicled an attempt
to revive the practice among the Brahmans of Travancore.
About thirty years before it had been abolished by the
British authorities, but previous to that time it was performed
by placing a small silver ball in a brazen vessel eight inches
deep, filled with boiling ghee. After various religious ceremonies,
the accused plunged in his hand, and sometimes was
obliged to repeat the attempt several times before he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
bring out the ball. The hand was then wrapped up in tender
palm leaves and examined after an interval of three days. In
1866 some Brahmans in danger of losing caste endeavored to
regain their position by obtaining permission to undergo a
modification of this trial, substituting cold oil for boiling ghee.
The authorities made no objection to this, but the holy society
refused to consider it a valid purgation.</p>

<p>Christian faith improved on the simplicity of pagan devices,
and was able, through the intermediation of men of supreme
sanctity, to induce Heaven to render the ordeal still more
miraculous. D’Achery quotes from a contemporary MS.
life of the holy Pons, Abbot of Andaone near Avignon, a
miracle which relates that one morning after mass, as he was
about to cross the Rhone, he met two men quarrelling over a
ploughshare, which, after being lost for several days, had been
found buried in the ground, and which each accused the
other of having purloined and hidden. As the question was
impenetrable to human wisdom, Pons intervened and told
them to place the ploughshare in the water of the river, within
easy reach. Then, making over it the sign of the cross, he
ordered the disputant who was most suspected to lift it out of
the river. The man accordingly plunged his arm into the
stream only to withdraw it, exclaiming that the water was
boiling, and showed his hand fearfully scalded, thus affording
the most satisfactory evidence of his guilt.<a id="FNanchor_902_902" href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> St. Bertrand,
Bishop of Comminges, adopted a similar method in a case of
disputed paternity. A poor woman came to him with a starving
infant, which the father refused to recognize or provide
for, lest such evidence of sin should render him ineligible for
an ecclesiastical benefice. The bishop summoned the offender,
who stoutly denied the allegation, until a vessel of cold water
was brought and a stone thrown in, when the bishop blessed
the water, and ordered the father to take out the stone, saying
that the result would show the truth or falsity of his assevera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>tions.
Full of confidence, the man plunged in his hand and
brought out the stone, with his hand scalded as though the
water had been boiling. He promptly admitted his guilt,
acknowledged the child, and thenceforth provided for it.<a id="FNanchor_903_903" href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a>
Similar to this was the incident which drove the holy St.
Gengulphus from the world. While yet a warrior and favorite
of King Pepin, during his travels in Italy he was attracted by
a way-side fountain, and bought it from the owner, who
imagined that it could not be removed from his possessions.
On his return to France, Gengulphus drove his staff into the
ground near his house, in a convenient place, and on its being
withdrawn next day, the obedient stream, which had followed
him from Italy, burst forth. He soon learned that during his
absence his wife had proved unfaithful to him with a priest,
and desiring to test her innocence, he took her to the fountain
and told her that she could disprove the reports against her by
picking up a hair which lay at the bottom of the pool. She
boldly did this, but on withdrawing her hand it was fearfully
scalded, the skin and flesh hanging in strips from her finger-ends.
He pardoned her and retired from the world, but she
was implacable, and took her revenge by inciting her paramour
to murder him.<a id="FNanchor_904_904" href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF RED-HOT IRON.</small></h3>


<p>In almost all ages there has existed the belief that under the
divine influence the human frame was able to resist the action
of fire. Even the sceptic Pliny seems to share the superstition
as to the families of the Hirpi, who at the annual sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
made to Apollo, on Mount Soracte, walked without injury
over piles of burning coals, in recognition of which, by a perpetual
senatus consultum, they were relieved from all public
burdens.<a id="FNanchor_905_905" href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> That fire applied either directly or indirectly
should be used in the appeal to God was therefore natural,
and the convenience with which it could be employed by means
of iron rendered that the most usual form of the ordeal. As
employed in Europe, under the name of <i>judicium ferri</i> or <i>juise</i>
it was administered in two essentially different forms. The
one (<i>vomeres igniti, examen pedale</i>) consisted in laying on the
ground at certain distances six, nine, or in some cases twelve,
red-hot ploughshares, among which the accused walked barefooted,
sometimes blindfolded, when it became an ordeal of
pure chance, and sometimes compelled to press each iron with
his naked feet.<a id="FNanchor_906_906" href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> The other and more usual form obliged the
patient to carry in his hand for a certain distance, usually nine
feet, a piece of red-hot iron, the weight of which was determined
by law and varied with the importance of the question
at issue or the magnitude of the alleged crime. Thus, among
the Anglo-Saxons, in the “simple ordeal” the iron weighed
one pound, in the “triple ordeal” three pounds. The latter
is prescribed for incendiaries and “morth-slayers” (secret
murderers), for false coining, and for plotting against the
king’s life; while at a later period, in the collection known as
the Laws of Henry I., we find it extended to cases of theft,
robbery, arson, and felonies in general.<a id="FNanchor_907_907" href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> In Sweden, for
theft, the form known as <i>trux iarn</i> was employed, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
the accused had to carry the red-hot iron and deposit it in a
hole twelve paces from the starting-point; in other cases the
ordeal was called <i>scuz iarn</i>, when he carried it nine paces and
then cast it from him. These ordeals were held on Wednesday,
after fasting on bread and water on Monday and Tuesday;
the hand or foot was washed, after which it was allowed
to touch nothing till it came in contact with the iron; it was
then wrapped up and sealed until Saturday, when it was
opened in presence of the accuser and the judges.<a id="FNanchor_908_908" href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> In Spain,
the iron had no definite weight, but was a palm and two
fingers in length, with four feet, high enough to enable the
criminal to lift it conveniently.<a id="FNanchor_909_909" href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> The episcopal benediction
was necessary to consecrate the iron to its judicial use. A
charter of 1082 shows that the Abbey of Fontanelle in Normandy
had one of approved sanctity, which, through the
ignorance of a monk, was applied to other purposes. The
Abbot thereupon asked the Archbishop of Rouen to consecrate
another, and before the latter would consent the institution
had to prove its right to administer the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_910_910" href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> The
wrapping up and sealing of the hand was a general custom,
derived from the East, and usually after three days it was uncovered
and the decision was rendered in accordance with its
condition.<a id="FNanchor_911_911" href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> These proceedings were accompanied by the
same solemn observances which have been already described,
the iron itself was duly exorcised, and the intervention of God
was invoked in the name of all the manifestations of Divine
clemency or wrath by the agency of fire—Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, the burning bush of Horeb, the destruction of
Sodom, and the day of judgment.<a id="FNanchor_912_912" href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> Occasionally, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
several criminals were examined together, the same piece of
heated iron was borne by them successively, giving a manifest
advantage to the last one, who had to endure a temperature
considerably less than his companions.<a id="FNanchor_913_913" href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a></p>

<p>In India this was one of the earliest forms of the ordeal, in
use even in the Vedic period, as it is referred to in the Khandogya
Upanishad of the Sama Veda, where the head of a
hatchet is alluded to as the implement employed for the trial—subsequently
replaced by a ploughshare.<a id="FNanchor_914_914" href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> In the seventh
century, A. D., Hiouen Thsang reports that the red-hot iron
was applied to the tongue of the accused as well as to the
palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, his innocence
being designated by the amount of resultant injury.<a id="FNanchor_915_915" href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> This
may have been a local custom, for, according to Institutes of
Vishnu, closely followed by Yajnavalkya, the patient bathes
and performs certain religious ceremonies; then after rubbing
his hands with rice bran, seven green asvattha leaves are
placed on the extended palms and bound with a thread. A
red-hot iron ball or spear-head, weighing about two pounds
and three-quarters, is then brought, and the judge adjures it—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all things like a
witness. O fire, thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.</p>

<p>“This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared
from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from
this perplexity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The glowing ball is then placed on the hands of the accused,
and with it he has to walk across seven concentric circles of
cow-dung, each with a radius sixteen fingers’ breadth larger
than the preceding, and throw the ball into a ninth circle,
where it must burn some grass placed there for the purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
If this be accomplished without burning the hands, he gains
his cause, but the slightest injury convicts him. A minimum
limit of a thousand pieces of silver was established at an early
period as requisite to justify the administration of this form of
ordeal in a suit.<a id="FNanchor_916_916" href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> But the robust faith in the power of innocence
characteristic of the earlier Hindus seems to have
diminished, for subsequent recensions of the code and later
lawgivers increase the protection afforded to the hand by adding
to the asvattha leaves additional strata of dharba grass and
barley moistened with curds, the whole bound around with
seven turns of raw silk.<a id="FNanchor_917_917" href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> Ali Ibrahim Khan relates a case
which he witnessed at Benares in 1783 in which a man named
Sancar, accused of larceny, offered to be tried in this manner.
The court deliberated for four months, urging the parties to
adopt some other mode, but they were obstinate, and being
both Hindus claimed their right to the ancient forms of law,
which was at last conceded. The ordeal took place in presence
of a large assemblage, when, to the surprise of every one,
Sancar carried the red-hot ball through the seven circles,
threw it duly into the ninth where it burnt the grass, and exhibited
his hands uninjured. By way of discouraging such
experiments for the future, the accuser was imprisoned for a
week.<a id="FNanchor_918_918" href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> Even in 1873, the Bombay <i>Gazette</i> states that this
ordeal is still practised in Oodeypur, where a case had shortly
before occurred wherein a husbandman had been obliged to
prove his innocence by holding a red-hot ploughshare in his
hands, duly guarded with peepul leaves, turning his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
towards the sun and invoking it: “Thou Sun-God, if I am
actually guilty of the crime, punish me; if not, let me escape
unscathed from the ordeal!”—and in this instance, also, the
accused was uninjured.</p>

<p>A peculiar modification of the hot-iron ordeal is employed
by the aboriginal hill-tribes of Rajmahal, in the north of Bengal,
when a person believes himself to be suffering from witchcraft.
The <i>Satane</i> and the <i>Cherreen</i> are used to find out the
witch, and then the decision is confirmed by a person representing
the sufferer, who, with certain religious ceremonies,
applies his tongue to a red-hot iron nine times, unless sooner
burnt. A burn is considered to render the guilt of the accused
indubitable, and his only appeal is to have the trial repeated
in public, when, if the same result follows, he is bound either
to cure the bewitched person or to suffer death if the latter
dies.<a id="FNanchor_919_919" href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></p>

<p>In the earlier periods of European law, the burning iron
was reserved for cases of peculiar atrocity. Thus we find it
prescribed by Charlemagne in accusations of parricide;<a id="FNanchor_920_920" href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> the
Council of Risbach in 799 directed its use in cases of sorcery
and witchcraft;<a id="FNanchor_921_921" href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> and among the Thuringians it was ordered
for women suspected of poisoning or otherwise murdering
their husbands<a id="FNanchor_922_922" href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>—a crime visited with peculiar severity in
almost all codes. In 848 the Council of Mainz indicates it
specially for slaves,<a id="FNanchor_923_923" href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> while the Council of Tribur, in 895,
orders it for all cases of accusation against freemen.<a id="FNanchor_924_924" href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> Among
the Anglo-Saxons the accuser had the right to select the
ordeal to be employed,<a id="FNanchor_925_925" href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> while at a later period in Germany this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
privilege was conferred on the accused.<a id="FNanchor_926_926" href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> In England it subsequently
became rather an aristocratic procedure as contradistinguished
from the water ordeals.<a id="FNanchor_927_927" href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> On the other hand, in
the Assises de Jerusalem the hot iron is the only form alluded
to as employed in the <i>roturier</i> courts;<a id="FNanchor_928_928" href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> in the laws of Nieuport,
granted by Philip of Alsace in 1163, it is prescribed as a
plebeian ordeal;<a id="FNanchor_929_929" href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> and about the same period, in the military
laws enacted by Frederic Barbarossa during his second Italian
expedition, it appears as a servile ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_930_930" href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> In the Russian law
of the eleventh century, it is ordered in all cases where the
matter at stake amounts to more than half a <i>grivna</i> of gold,
while the water ordeal is reserved for suits of less importance.<a id="FNanchor_931_931" href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a>
In the Icelandic code of the twelfth century it is prescribed
for men, in cases in which women are required to undergo the
hot-water ordeal;<a id="FNanchor_932_932" href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> while the reverse of this is seen in an
English case occurring in 1201, where six men and a woman
were accused of burglary; the men were ordered to the water
ordeal and the woman to red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_933_933" href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> A specially severe
form was provided for women in Ireland, who, when accused,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
were obliged to lick with the tongue a bronze axe-head heated
to redness in a fire of black-thorn.<a id="FNanchor_934_934" href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></p>

<p>Irrespective of these distinctions, we find it to have been
the mode usually selected by persons of rank when compelled
to throw themselves upon the judgment of God. The Empress
Richardis, wife of Charles le Gros, accused in 887 of
adultery with Bishop Liutward, offered to prove her innocence
either by the judicial combat or the red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_935_935" href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> So when
the Emperor St. Henry II. indulged in unworthy doubts of
the purity of his virgin-wife St. Cunigunda, she eagerly appealed
to the judgment of God, and established her innocence
by treading unharmed the burning ploughshares.<a id="FNanchor_936_936" href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> The tragical
tradition of Mary, wife of the Third Otho, contains a
similar example, with the somewhat unusual variation of an
accuser undergoing an ordeal to prove a charge. The empress,
hurried away by a sudden and unconquerable passion
for Amula, Count of Modena, in 996, repeated in all its details
the story of Potiphar’s wife. The unhappy count, unceremoniously
condemned to lose his head, asserted his innocence
to his wife, and entreated her to clear his reputation. He was
executed, and the countess, seeking an audience of the emperor,
disproved the calumny by carrying unharmed the red-hot
iron, when Otho, convinced of his rashness by this
triumphant vindication, immediately repaired his injustice by
consigning his empress to the stake.<a id="FNanchor_937_937" href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> When Edward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Confessor, who entertained a not unreasonable dislike for his
mother Emma, listened eagerly to the accusation of her criminal
intimacy with Alwyn, Bishop of Winchester, she was condemned
to undergo the ordeal of the burning shares, and,
walking over them barefooted and unharmed, she established
beyond peradventure the falsehood of the charge.<a id="FNanchor_938_938" href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a> So when
in 943 Arnoul of Flanders had procured the assassination of
William Longsword, Duke of Normandy, at Pecquigny, he
offered to Louis d’Outremer to clear himself of complicity in
the murder by the ordeal of fire.<a id="FNanchor_939_939" href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> Robert Curthose, son of
William the Conqueror, while in exile during his youthful
rebellion against his father, formed an intimacy with a pretty
girl. Years afterwards, when he was Duke of Normandy,
she presented herself before him with two likely youths, whom
she asserted to be pledges of his former affection. Robert was
incredulous; but the mother, carrying unhurt the red-hot iron,
forced him to forego his doubts and to acknowledge the
paternity of the boys, whom he thenceforth adopted.<a id="FNanchor_940_940" href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> Indeed
this was the legal form of proof in cases of disputed
paternity established by the Scandinavian legislation at this
period,<a id="FNanchor_941_941" href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> and in that of Spain a century later.<a id="FNanchor_942_942" href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> Remy, Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
of Dorchester, when accused of treason against William the
Conqueror, was cleared by the devotion of a follower, who
underwent the ordeal of hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_943_943" href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> When, in 1098, William
Rufus desired to supply his treasury by confiscations, he accused
about fifty of his richest Saxon subjects of having killed
deer in his forests and hurried them to the hot-iron ordeal,
but he was stupefied when after the third day their hands were
found to be unhurt.<a id="FNanchor_944_944" href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> In 1143, Henry I., Archbishop of Mainz,
ordered its employment, and administered it himself, in a
controversy between the Abbey of Gerode and the Counts of
Hirschberg. In the special charter issued to the abbey attesting
the decision of the trial, it is recorded that the hand of
the ecclesiastical champion was not only uninjured by the fiery
metal, but was positively benefited by it.<a id="FNanchor_945_945" href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> About the same
period, Centulla IV. of Béarn caused it to be employed in a
dispute with the Bishop of Lescar concerning the fine paid for
the murder of a priest, the ecclesiastic, as usual, being victorious.<a id="FNanchor_946_946" href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a>
The reward of the church for its faith in adopting
these pagan customs was seen in the well-known case by which
Bishop Poppo of Slesvick, in 962, succeeded in convincing
and converting the Pagan Danes even as, three thousand years
earlier, according to the Persian historians, Zoroaster convinced
King Gushtashp of the truth of his revelation from
Hormazd,<a id="FNanchor_947_947" href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> and, within seven centuries, Adurabad converted
the heretical Mazdeans. The worthy missionary, dining with
King Harold Blaatand, denounced, with more zeal than discretion,
the indigenous deities as lying devils. The king
dared him to prove his faith in his God, and, on his assenting,
caused next morning an immense piece of iron to be duly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
heated, which the undaunted Poppo grasped and carried
around to the satisfaction of the royal court, displaying his
hand unscathed by the glowing mass; or, as a variant of the
legend asserts, he drew on an iron gauntlet reaching to the
elbow and heated to redness. The miracle was sufficient, and
Denmark thenceforth becomes an integral portion of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_948_948" href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a>
Somewhat similar, except in its results, was a case
in which a priest involved in a theological dispute with a Jew,
and unable to overcome him in argument, offered to prove the
divinity of Christ by carrying a burning brand in his naked
hand. Invoking the name of Jesus, the faithful ecclesiastic
drew the blazing wood from the fire and slowly carried it
for a considerable distance, but though he triumphantly exhibited
his hand unhurt, his obdurate antagonist refused to be
converted, alleging that the miracle was the result of magic.<a id="FNanchor_949_949" href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a>
In Norway, the sanctity of St. Olaf the King was attested in
the same way, when he thoughtlessly whittled a twig on Sunday,
and his attention was respectfully called by one of his
courtiers to this violation of the sabbatical rules. By way
of penance he collected the chips, placed them on the palm
of one hand, and set fire to them, but after they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
reduced to ashes, to the surprise of the bystanders, his hand
was found unharmed.<a id="FNanchor_950_950" href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a></p>

<p>In fact, there was scarcely a limit to the credulity which
looked for the constant interference of the divine power.
About 1215 some heretics at Cambrai were convicted by the
hot iron and sentenced to the stake. One of them was of
noble birth, and on the way to the place of execution the
priest who had conducted the proceedings exhorted him to
repentance and conversion. The condemned man listened
willingly, and commenced to confess his errors. As he proceeded
his hand commenced to heal, and when he had received
absolution there remained no trace of the burn. When he
was called in turn to take his place at the stake, the priest
interposed, saying that he was innocent, and, on examination
of the hand, he was released. About the same time a similar
occurrence is recorded at Strassburg, where ten heretics had
been thus convicted and condemned to be burnt, and one repenting
at the last moment was cured of his burn, and was
discharged. In this case, however, on his return to his house
near the town, his wife upbraided him for his weakness in betraying
the eternal truth to avoid a momentary suffering, and
under her influence he relapsed. Immediately the burn on
his hand reappeared, and a similar one took possession of his
wife’s hand, scorching both to the bone and inflicting such
excruciating agony that being unable to repress their screams,
and fearing to betray themselves, they took to the woods,
where they howled like wolves. Concealment was impossible,
however. They were discovered, carried to the city, where
the ashes of their accomplices were not yet cold, and both
promptly shared the same fate.<a id="FNanchor_951_951" href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> Somewhat similar is a case
recorded in York, where a woman accused of homicide was
exposed to the ordeal, resulting in a blister the size of a half
walnut. She was accordingly convicted by a jury of knights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
but on her offering a prayer at the tomb of St. William of
York the blister disappeared. Thereupon the royal justiciaries
dismissed her as innocent, and declared the jury to be at the
king’s mercy for rendering a false verdict.<a id="FNanchor_952_952" href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a></p>

<p>No form of ordeal was more thoroughly introduced throughout
the whole extent of Europe. From Spain to Constantinople,
and from Scandinavia to Naples, it was appealed to
with confidence as an unfailing mode of ascertaining the will of
Heaven. The term <i>judicium</i>, indeed, was at length understood
to mean an ordeal, and generally that of hot iron, and
in its barbarized form, <i>juise</i>, may almost always be considered
to indicate this particular kind. In the Swedish law of the
early 13th century, the red-hot iron was used in a large
number of crimes, and the ferocity of its employment is exemplified
in the formula prescribed for homicide. A person
accused of murder on suspicion was always obliged to justify
himself by carrying the hot iron for nine steps; and if he did
not appear to stand his trial when duly summoned, he might
be forced to undergo a preliminary ordeal to prove that he
had been unavoidably detained. If he failed in this, he was
condemned as guilty, but if he succeeded in enduring it he
was forced to perform the second ordeal to clear him of the
crime itself; while the heir of the murdered man, so long as
no one succumbed in the trial, could successively accuse ten
men; for the last of whom, however, the nine burning ploughshares
were substituted.<a id="FNanchor_953_953" href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> In the code of the Frankish kingdoms
of the East, it is the only mode alluded to, except the
duel, and it there retained its legal authority long after it had
become obsolete elsewhere. The Assises de Jerusalem were in
force in the Venetian colonies until the sixteenth century, and
the manuscript preserved officially in the archives of Venice,
described by Morelli as written in 1436, retains the primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
directions for the employment of the <i>juise</i>.<a id="FNanchor_954_954" href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> Even the Venetian
translation, commenced in 1531, and finished in 1536, is
equally scrupulous, although an act of the Council of Ten,
April 10, 1535, shows that these customs had fallen into desuetude
and had been formally abolished.<a id="FNanchor_955_955" href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> In Hungary, the
judicial records of Waradin from 1209 to 1235 contain 389
judgments, of which a large part were determined by the hot-iron
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_956_956" href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a></p>

<p>This ordeal even became partially naturalized among the
Greeks, probably as a result of the Latin domination at Constantinople.
In the middle of the thirteenth century, the
Emperor Theodore Lascaris demanded that Michael Paleologus,
who afterwards wore the imperial crown, should clear
himself of an accusation in this manner; but the Archbishop
of Philadelphia, on being appealed to, pronounced that it was
a custom of the barbarians, condemned by the canons, and
not to be employed except by the special order of the emperor.<a id="FNanchor_957_957" href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a>
Yet George Pachymere speaks of the custom as one not uncommon
in his youth, and he describes at some length the
ceremonies with which it was performed.<a id="FNanchor_958_958" href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a></p>

<p>In Europe, even as late as 1310, in the proceedings against
the Order of the Templars, at Mainz, Count Frederic, the
master preceptor of the Rhenish provinces, offered to substantiate
his denial of the accusations by carrying the red-hot
iron.<a id="FNanchor_959_959" href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> In Modena in 1329, in a dispute between the German
soldiers of Louis of Bavaria and the citizens, the Germans
offered to settle the question by carrying a red-hot bar; but
when the townsfolks themselves accomplished the feat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
triumphantly showed that no burn had been inflicted, the
Germans denied the proof, and asserted that magic had been
employed.<a id="FNanchor_960_960" href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a></p>

<p>Though about this time it may be considered to have disappeared
from the ordinary proceedings of the secular courts,
there was one class of cases in which its vitality still continued
for a century and a half. The mysterious crime of witchcraft
was so difficult of proof that judicial ingenuity was taxed to
its utmost to secure conviction, and the Devil was always
ready to aid his followers and baffle the ends of justice. The
Inquisitor Sprenger, writing in 1487, therefore recommends
that, when a witch cannot be forced to confess her guilt by
either prayers or torture, she shall be asked whether she will
undergo the ordeal of red-hot iron; to this she will eagerly
assent, knowing that she can rely on the friendly assistance of
Satan to carry her through it unscathed, and this readiness
will be good evidence of her guilt. He warns inexperienced
judges moreover not to allow the trial to take place, and thus
afford to Satan the opportunity of triumph, and instances a
case which occurred in 1484 before the Count of Furstenberg.
A well-known witch was arrested and tried, but no confession
could be extorted from her by all the refinements of torture.
Finally she offered to prove her innocence with the red-hot
iron, and the Count being young and unwary accepted the
proposal, sentencing her to carry it three paces. She carried
it for six paces and offered to hold it still longer, exhibiting her
hand uninjured. The Count was forced to acquit her, and at
the time that Sprenger wrote she was still living, to the scandal
of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_961_961" href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a></p>

<p>After the judicial use of the red-hot iron had at last died
out, the superstition on which it was based still lingered, and
men believed that God would reverse the laws of nature to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
accomplish a special object. About 1670 Georg Frese, a
merchant of Hamburg, distinguished for piety and probity,
published an account, the truth of which was vouched for by
many respectable eye-witnesses, stating that a friend of his
named Witzendorff, who had bound himself to a young woman
by terrible oaths, and then had proved false and caused her
death, fell into a despairing melancholy. He accused himself
of the sin against the Holy Ghost, declared that his salvation
was impossible, and refused to hope unless he could see a
miracle wrought in his behalf. Frese at length asked him
what miracle he required, and on his replying that he must
see that fire would not burn, the intrepid consoler went to a
blazing fire, picked out the burning coals and also a red-hot
ring, which he brought to the sinner with uninjured hands and
convinced him that he could be saved by repentance. The
moral drawn from the facts by the narrator to whom we owe
them, is that he who under Divine influence undertakes such
ordeals will be preserved unharmed.<a id="FNanchor_962_962" href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a></p>

<p>Even as we have seen that Heaven sometimes interposed to
punish the guilty by a reversal of the hot-water ordeal, so the
industrious belief of the Middle Ages found similar miracles
in the hot-iron trial, especially when Satan or some other
mysterious influence nullified the appeal to God. Early in
the thirteenth century a case is related in which a peasant to
revenge himself on a neighbor employed a vagabond monk to
burn the house of the latter. The hot-iron ordeal was vainly
employed on all suspected of the crime; the house was rebuilt,
the monk again bribed, burnt it a second time, and again the
ordeal proved vain. The owner again rebuilt his house, and
kept in it the ordeal-iron, ready for use. The monk, tempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
with fresh promises, paid him another visit, and was hospitably
received as before, when seeing the piece of iron, his curiosity
was aroused and he asked what it was. The host handed it
to him, explaining its use, but as soon as the wretch took it, it
burned him to the bone, when the other seeing in him the incendiary,
seized him; he was duly tried, confessed his guilt,
and was broken on the wheel.<a id="FNanchor_963_963" href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> A variant of this story relates
how a man accused of arson offered to prove his innocence by
the red-hot iron, which he carried for a long distance and
then showed his hand uninjured. The ordeal-iron mysteriously
vanished and could not be found, until a year afterwards,
when a laborer who was mending the highway came upon it
under a layer of sand. It was still glowing fiercely, and when
he attempted to pick it up, it burnt him severely. The bystanders
at once suspected him of the crime, and on the appropriate
means being taken he was forced to confess his guilt,
which was duly punished by the wheel.<a id="FNanchor_964_964" href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> A less tragical example
of the same form of miracle was that wrought by the
holy Suidger, Bishop of Munster, who suspected his chamberlain
of the theft of a cup. As the man stoutly denied his
guilt, Suidger ordered him to pick up a knife from the table,
after he had mentally exorcised it. The cold metal burnt the
culprit’s hand as though it had been red-hot, and he promptly
confessed his crime.<a id="FNanchor_965_965" href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF FIRE.</small></h3>


<p>The ordeal of fire, administered directly, without the intervention
either of water or of iron, is one of the most ancient
forms, as is shown by the allusions to it in both the Hindu
Vedic writings, the adventure of Siawush, and the passage in
the Antigone of Sophocles (pp. 266, 267, 270). In this, its
simplest form, it may be considered the origin of the proverbial
expression, “J’en mettrois la main au feu,” as an
affirmation of positive belief,<a id="FNanchor_966_966" href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> showing how thoroughly the
whole system engrained itself in the popular mind. In
India, as practised in modern times, its form approaches
somewhat the ordeal of the burning ploughshares. A trench
is dug nine hands in length, two spans in breadth, and one
span in depth. This is filled with peepul wood, which is then
set on fire, and the accused walks into it with bare feet.<a id="FNanchor_967_967" href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> A
more humane modification is described in the seventh century
by Hiouen-Thsang as in use when the accused was too tender
to undergo the trial by red-hot iron. He simply cast into
the flames certain flower-buds, when, if they opened their
leaves, he was acquitted; if they were burnt up, he was condemned.<a id="FNanchor_968_968" href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a></p>

<p>An anticipation of the fire ordeal may be found in the Rabbinical
story of Abraham when he was cast into a fiery fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>nace
by Nimrod, for reproving the idolatry of the latter, and
escaped unharmed from the flames;<a id="FNanchor_969_969" href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> as well as the similar experience
of Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego, when they
were saved from the wrath of Nebuchadnezzar.<a id="FNanchor_970_970" href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> Miraculous
interposition of this kind was expected as a matter of course
by the early Christians. About the year 400 Rufinus, in his
account of his visit to the monks of the Nitrian desert, tells
an adventure of the hermit Copres as related to him by that
holy man himself. On visiting a neighboring city he engaged
in a disputation with a Manichæan who was perverting
the people. Finding the heretic not easily overcome by
argument, he proposed that a fire should be built in the public
square, into which both should enter. The populace was delighted
with the idea and speedily had a roaring pyre ready,
when the Manichæan insisted that the Christian should enter
first. Copres assented and remained unhurt in the flames for
half an hour; his antagonist still held back, when the crowd
seized him and tossed him into the fire, where he was severely
scorched, and was ejected with disgrace from the city.<a id="FNanchor_971_971" href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a>
Almost identical is the story related in 597 A. D., under the
Emperor Anastasius, of a Catholic bishop, who, after being
worsted in a theological dispute by the subtle logic of an
Arian, offered to test the soundness of their respective doctrines
by together entering a blazing fire. The prudent Arian
declined the proposition, when the enthusiastic Catholic
jumped into the burning pile, and thence continued the controversy
without suffering the least inconvenience.<a id="FNanchor_972_972" href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> In the
less impressive form of filling the lap with burning coals and
carrying them uninjured till they grew cold this ordeal seems
to have been a favorite with holy men accused of unchastity.
It is related of St. Brice, the successor of St. Martin in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
see of Tours, of St. Simplicius of Autun, and of Montano
bishop of Toledo in the sixth century.<a id="FNanchor_973_973" href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a></p>

<p>The earliest legal allusion to this form of ordeal in Europe
occurs in the code of the Ripuarian Franks, where it is prescribed
as applicable to slaves and strangers, in some cases of
doubt.<a id="FNanchor_974_974" href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> From the phraseology of these passages, we may
conclude that it was then administered by placing the hand of
the accused in a fire. As a legal ordeal this is perhaps the
only allusion to it in European jurisprudence, but it was repeatedly
resorted to by enthusiasts as a voluntary trial for the
purpose of establishing the truth of accusations or of substantiating
their position. In these cases it was conducted on a
larger and more impressive scale; huge pyres were built, and
the individual undergoing the trial literally walked through
the flames, as Siawush did. The celebrated Petrus Igneus
gained his surname and reputation by an exploit of this kind,
which was renowned in its day. Pietro di Pavia, Bishop of
Florence, unpopular with the citizens, but protected by Godfrey,
Duke of Tuscany, was accused of simony and heresy.
Being acquitted by the Council of Rome, in 1063, and the
offer of his accusers to prove his guilt by the ordeal of fire
being refused, he endeavored to put down his adversaries by
tyranny and oppression. Great disturbances resulted, and at
length, in 1067, the monks of Vallombrosa, who had borne a
leading part in denouncing the bishop, and who had suffered
severely in consequence (the episcopal troops having burned
the monastery of St. Salvio and slaughtered the cenobites),
resolved to decide the question by the ordeal, incited thereto
by no less than three thousand enthusiastic Florentines who
assembled there for the purpose. Pietro Aldobrandini, a monk
of Vallombrosa, urged by his superior, the holy S. Giovanni
Gualberto, offered himself to undergo the trial. After im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>posing
religious ceremonies, he walked slowly between two
piles of blazing wood, ten feet long, five feet wide, and four
and a half feet high, the passage between them being six feet
wide and covered with an inch or two of glowing coals. The
violence of the flames agitated his dress and hair, but he
emerged without hurt, even the hair on his legs being unsinged,
barelegged and barefooted though he was. Desiring to return
through the pyre, he was prevented by the admiring crowd,
who rushed around him in triumph, kissing his feet and garments,
and endangering his life in their transports, until he
was rescued by his fellow monks. A formal statement of the
facts was sent to Rome by the Florentines, the papal court
gave way, and the bishop was deposed; while the monk who
had given so striking a proof of his steadfast faith was marked
for promotion, and eventually died Cardinal of Albano.<a id="FNanchor_975_975" href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a></p>

<p>An example of a similar nature occurred in Milan in 1103,
when the Archbishop Grossolano was accused of simony by
a priest named Liutprand, who, having no proof to sustain
his charge, offered the ordeal of fire. All the money he could
raise he expended in procuring fuel, and when all was ready
the partisans of the archbishop attacked the preparations and
carried off the wood. The populace, deprived of the promised
exhibition, grew turbulent, and Grossolano was obliged not
only to assent to the trial, but to join the authorities in providing
the necessary materials. In the Piazza di S. Ambrogio
two piles were accordingly built, each ten cubits long, by four
cubits in height and width, with a gangway between them of
a cubit and a half. As the undaunted priest entered the
blazing mass, the flames divided before him and closed as he
passed, allowing him to emerge in safety, although with two
slight injuries, one a burn on the hand, received while sprinkling
the fire before entering, the other on the foot, which he
attributed to a kick from a horse in the crowd that awaited his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
exit. The evidence was accepted as conclusive by the people,
and Grossolano was obliged to retire to Rome. Pascal II.,
however, received him graciously, and the Milanese suffragans
disapproved of the summary conviction of their metropolitan,
to which they were probably all equally liable. The injuries
received by Liutprand were exaggerated, a tumult was excited
in Milan, the priest was obliged to seek safety in flight, and
Grossolano was restored for a time, but the adverse party prevailed
and in spite of papal support he was forced to exile.<a id="FNanchor_976_976" href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a></p>

<p>A volunteer miracle of somewhat the same character, which
is recorded as occurring in Paris early in the thirteenth century,
may be alluded to as illustrating the belief of the period.
A loose woman in the household of a great noble was luring
the youthful retainers to sin, when the chaplain remonstrated
with his master, and threatened to depart unless she was removed.
When she was taxed with her guilt she defended herself
by saying that the priest had accused her because she had
refused his importunities, and offered to prove it. Approaching
him as a penitent, she sought to seduce his virtue, finally
threatening to kill herself unless he would gratify her despairing
love, until, to prevent her suicide, he finally made an appointment
with her. Secretly announcing her triumph to the
noble, she went to the place of meeting, where she found the
chaplain mounted on a bed of plank, surrounded by straw and
dry wood, to which he set fire on her appearance, and invited
her to join him. Covered by the flames, the sinless man felt
nothing but a cool, refreshing breeze, and when the pile had
burnt out, he emerged unhurt, even his garments and hair
being untouched.<a id="FNanchor_977_977" href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a></p>

<p>But the experiment was not always so successful for the rash
enthusiast. In 1098, during the first crusade, after the cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>ture
of Antioch, when the Christians were in turn besieged in
that city, and, sorely pressed and famine-struck, were well-nigh
reduced to despair, an ignorant peasant named Peter
Bartholomew, a follower of Raymond of Toulouse, announced
a series of visions in which St. Andrew and the Saviour had
revealed to him that the lance which pierced the side of Christ
lay hidden in the church of St. Peter. After several men had
dug in the spot indicated, from morning until night, without
success, Peter leaped into the trench, and by a few well-directed
strokes of his mattock exhumed the priceless relic, which he
presented to Count Raymond. Cheered by this, and by various
other manifestations of Divine assistance, the Christians gained
heart, and defeated the Infidels with immense slaughter. Peter
became a man of mark, and had fresh visions on all important
conjunctures. Amid the jealousies and dissensions which raged
among the Frankish chiefs, the possession of the holy lance
vastly increased Raymond’s importance, and rival princes were
found to assert that it was merely a rusty Arab weapon, hidden
for the occasion, and wholly undeserving the veneration
of which it was the object. At length, after some months,
during the leisure of the siege of Archas, the principal ecclesiastics
in the camp investigated the matter, and Peter, to
silence the doubts expressed as to his veracity, offered to
vindicate the identity of the relic by the fiery ordeal. He
was taken at his word, and after three days allowed for fasting
and prayer, a pile of dry olive-branches was made, fourteen
feet long and four feet high, with a passage-way one foot
wide. In the presence of forty thousand men all eagerly
awaiting the result, Peter, bearing the object in dispute, and
clothed only in a tunic, boldly rushed through the flames,
amid the anxious prayers and adjurations of the multitude.
As the chroniclers lean to the side of the Neapolitan Princes
or of the Count of Toulouse, so do their accounts of the
event differ; the former asserting that Peter sustained mortal
injury in the fire; the latter assuring us that he emerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
safely, with but one or two slight burns, and that the crowd
enthusiastically pressing around him in triumph, he was thrown
down, trampled on, and injured so severely that he died in a
few days, asseverating with his latest breath the truth of his
revelations. Raymond persisted in upholding the sanctity of
his relic, but it was subsequently lost.<a id="FNanchor_978_978" href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a></p>

<p>Even after the efforts of Innocent III. to abolish the ordeal,
and while the canons of the Council of Lateran were still fresh,
St. Francis of Assisi, in 1219, offered himself to the flames for
the propagation of the faith. In his missionary trip to the
East, finding the Soldan deaf to his proselyting eloquence, he
proposed to test the truth of their respective religions by
entering a blazing pile in company with some imams, who
naturally declined the perilous experiment. Nothing daunted,
the enthusiastic saint then said that he would traverse the
flames alone if the Soldan would bind himself, in the event of
a triumphant result, to embrace the Christian religion and to
force his subjects to follow the example. The Turk, more
wary than the Dane whom Poppo converted, declined the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
proposition, and St. Francis returned from his useless voyage
unharmed.<a id="FNanchor_979_979" href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a></p>

<p>In this St. Francis endeavored unsuccessfully to emulate the
glorious achievement of Boniface, the Apostle of Russia, who,
according to the current martyrologies, converted the King of
Russia to the true faith by means of such a bargain and
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_980_980" href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> It is a little curious that Peter Cantor, in his diatribe
against the judgment of God, presents the supposition of
a trial such as this as an unanswerable argument against the
system—the Church, he says, could not assent to such an experiment,
and therefore it ought not to be trusted in affairs of
less magnitude.<a id="FNanchor_981_981" href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a></p>

<p>Somewhat irregular as a judicial proceeding, but yet illustrating
the general belief in the principles of the ordeal of fire,
was an occurrence related about the year 1220 by Cæsarius of
Heisterbach as having taken place a few years before in Arras.
An ecclesiastic of good repute decoyed a goldsmith into his
house, and murdered him to obtain possession of some valuables,
cutting up the body, with the assistance of a younger
sister, and hiding the members in a drain. The crime was
proved upon them, and both were condemned to the stake.
On the way to the place of punishment, the girl demanded a
confessor, and confessed her sins with full contrition, but the
brother was obdurate and impenitent. Both were tied to the
same stake; the brother was promptly reduced to ashes, while
the flames were deliciously cool to the sister, and only burnt
the rope with which she was tied, so that she quietly walked
down from the pile. The judges, thus convinced of her innocence,
dismissed her without further trouble.<a id="FNanchor_982_982" href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a></p>

<p>From every point of view, however, both as to date and as
to consequences, the most remarkable recourse to the fire
ordeal was that which proved to be the proximate cause of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
downfall of Savonarola. Long after the ordeal system had
been superseded in European jurisprudence, and occurring in
the centre of the New Learning, it was a most noteworthy
illustration of the superstition which formed a common bond
between sceptics and religious enthusiasts. In 1498 Savonarola
had been silenced by command of Alexander III., his
influence with the people was waning, and his faithful follower
Fra Domenico da Pescia was desperately struggling in the
pulpit to maintain the cause against the assaults of the Franciscans
led by the eloquent Fra Francesco della Puglia. Domenico
in a sermon offered to prove the truth of his leader’s
utterances by throwing himself from the roof of the Palazzo
de’ Signori, by casting himself in the river, or by entering
fire. This burst of rhetoric might have passed unheeded had
not Fra Francesco taken it up and offered to share the ordeal
with Savonarola himself. Savonarola declined, except under
impossible conditions, but Domenico accepted the challenge
and affixed to the portal of Santa Croce a paper in which he
offered to prove by argument or miracle the truth of sundry
propositions bearing upon his teacher’s mission. To this Fra
Francesco replied that he would enter fire with Fra Domenico;
that he fully expected to be burnt, but that he would willingly
suffer if he could disabuse the people of their false idol.
Popular excitement rose to such a height that the Signoria
sent for both disputants, and made them sign a written agreement
to undergo the ordeal. In this Fra Francesco wisely
provided that, although he was willing to enter fire with
Savonarola himself, if Domenico was to act he would only
produce a champion, who was readily found in the person of
Fra Giuliano Rondinelli. On the side of the Dominicans the
enthusiasm was so great that all the friars of Savonarola’s convent
of San Marco, nearly three hundred in number, eagerly
signed a pledge to submit to the ordeal, and he assured them
that in such a cause they could do so without danger. In
fact, when, on the day before the trial, he preached on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
subject in San Marco, the whole audience rose as one man
and offered to take Domenico’s place.</p>

<p>April 7th was the day fixed for the <i>Sperimento del Fuoco</i>.
In the Piazza de’ Signori a huge pile of wood, plentifully reinforced
with gunpowder, sulphur, oil, and spirits, was built
with a gangway through which the champions were to pass;
it was to be lighted at one end, and after they entered fire was
to be set at the other to preclude retreat. All Florence assembled
to witness the spectacle, and patiently endured the peltings
of a terrible storm. The day was spent, however, in
wrangling over questions skilfully raised by the Franciscans,
the chief one being whether Fra Domenico should carry in
his hand a consecrated host. It had been revealed to one of
his brethren that this was indispensable, and Savonarola
adhered to it firmly. When evening came the Signoria
announced that the ordeal was abandoned. The crowd was
enraged at the loss of the promised exhibition; the Dominicans
had so confidently promised a miracle that the drawn
battle was universally regarded as their defeat, an armed
guard was required to protect their return to their convent,
and Savonarola’s power over the Florentine populace was
gone. His enemies lost no time in pushing their advantage.
The next evening the mob assailed San Marco; he was seized
and conveyed to prison, and after prolonged and repeated
tortures he was hanged and burnt on May 23d.<a id="FNanchor_983_983" href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that the ordeal of fire was principally
affected by ecclesiastics in church affairs, perhaps because it
was of a nature to produce a powerful impression on the
spectators, while at the same time it could no doubt in many
instances be so managed as to secure the desired results by
those who controlled the details. In like manner, it was
occasionally employed on inanimate matter to decide points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
of faith or polity. Thus, in the question which excited great
commotion in Spain, in 1077, as to the substitution of the
Roman for the Gothic or Mozarabic rite, after a judicial combat
had been fought and determined in favor of the national
ritual, the partisans of the Roman offices continued to urge
their cause, and the ordeal of fire was appealed to. A missal
of each kind was committed to the flames, and, to the great
joy of all patriotic Castilians, the Gothic offices were unconsumed.<a id="FNanchor_984_984" href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a>
More satisfactory to the orthodox was the result of
a similar ordeal during the efforts of St. Dominic to convert
the Albigenses. In a dispute with some heretics he wrote out
his argument on the points of faith, and gave it to them for
examination and reply. That night, as they were seated
around the hearth, the paper was produced and read, when
one of them proposed that it should be cast into the flames,
when, if it remained unconsumed, they would see that its contents
were true. This was promptly done, when the saintly
document was unharmed. One, more obstinate than the rest,
asked for a second and then for a third trial, with the same
result. The perverse heretics, however, closed their hearts
against the truth, and bound themselves by oath to keep the
affair secret; and so glorious a victory for the true faith would
have remained unknown but for the indiscretion of one of
them, a knight, who had a covert inclination towards orthodoxy.<a id="FNanchor_985_985" href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a>
A somewhat similar instance occurred in Constantinople
as late as the close of the thirteenth century, when
Andronicus II., on his accession, found the city torn into
factions relative to the patriarchate, arising from the expulsion
of Arsenius, a former patriarch. All attempts to soothe the
dissensions proving vain, at length both parties agreed to
write out their respective statements and arguments, and,
committing both books to the flames, to abide by the result,
each side hoping that its manuscript would be preserved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
the special interposition of Heaven. The ceremony was conducted
with imposing state, and, to the general surprise, both
books were reduced to ashes. Singularly enough, all parties
united in the sensible conclusion that God had thereby commanded
them to forget their differences and to live in peace.<a id="FNanchor_986_986" href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a></p>

<p>About the same period as this last example, Samaritan
tradition related that the comparative claims of Mt. Gerizim
and Al-Qods (Jerusalem) as the sole seats of Yahveh-worship
were settled before Nebuchadnezzar, by the ordeal of fire,
applied respectively to the Pentateuch and to the later books
of the Jewish canon, Sanballat appearing for Ephraim, and
Zerubbabel for Judah. The later books were promptly consumed,
but the law of Moses emerged twice from the flames
unhurt. Zerubbabel, in despair, then spat upon some pages of
the index, and cast the Law a third time into the fire, when
the leaves thus polluted were burnt, but the book itself leaped
unscathed into the bosom of the king, who promptly slew the
representatives of Judah, and gave an unhesitating verdict in
favor of the Samaritans.<a id="FNanchor_987_987" href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a></p>

<p>The genuineness of relics was often tested in this manner
by exposing them to the action of fire. This custom, like the
ordeal itself as a judicial process, finds its original home in
the East. When, for instance, the sacred tooth-relic of
Buddha was carried to the court of King Pandu at Patali-putta,
and its holiness was questioned by the Niganthas, or
worshippers of Siva, they tested it by casting it into a pit
filled with glowing charcoal “bright and horrid as the hell
Roruva”—when the tooth, in place of being consumed to
ashes, rose out of the fiery mass resting on a lotus the size of
a chariot-wheel.<a id="FNanchor_988_988" href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> Even Roman unbelief accepted a similar
faith respecting the superfluous thumb which ornamented the
right foot of King Pyrrhus, the touch of which cured diseases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
of the spleen, and which remained unharmed on the funeral
pyre which consumed the rest of his body to ashes. The indestructible
supplementary member was thereupon inclosed in
a casket, and reverently placed in a temple—the first relic,
probably, on record in the western world.<a id="FNanchor_989_989" href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> At how early an
age Christianity adopted the belief which led to this is manifested
by the story of the swaddling-cloth of Christ in one of
the apocryphal Gospels. The Virgin, being unable, on account
of poverty, to make a return for the offerings of the
Magi who came to worship the infant Saviour, presented them
with one of his swaddling-bands. On their return they placed
it in the sacred fire of their altar, and though the flames eagerly
embraced it, they left it unharmed and unaltered, whereupon
the Magi venerated it, and laid it away among their treasures.<a id="FNanchor_990_990" href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a>
On the conversion of the Spanish Arians the experiment was
tried on a larger scale. It seems that doubts were felt by the
orthodox as to the relics preserved in their churches, and a
general regulation was adopted by the Council of Saragossa in
592 that they should be all brought before the bishops and
tested by fire—with what result is not recorded.<a id="FNanchor_991_991" href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a></p>

<p>In such cases the ceremony of the ordeal was conducted
with appropriate religious services, including the following
prayer, which would seem to show that in its regular form it
was not the relic itself, but the cloth in which it was wrapped
that was exposed to the test—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, who art king of kings and lord of lords,
and lover of all believers in thee, who art a just judge, strong
and powerful, who hast revealed thy holy mysteries to thy
priests, and who didst mitigate the flames to the Three Children;
concede to us thy unworthy servants and grant our
prayers that this cloth or this thread in which are wrapped
those bodies of saints, if they are not genuine let them be
burned by this fire, and if they are genuine let them escape, so
that iniquity shall not prevail over injustice but falsehood shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
succumb to truth, so that thy truth shall be declared to thee
and be manifested to us, believers in thee, that we may know
thee to be the blessed God in ages everlasting. Amen.<a id="FNanchor_992_992" href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Numerous instances of this superiority of relics to fire are
narrated by the pious chroniclers of the middle ages. In
1015 some monastic pilgrims, hospitably received at Monte
Cassino on their return from Jerusalem, offered at the shrine
of St. Benedict a fragment of the towel with which the Saviour
had washed the feet of his disciples. Some of the
monks, being incredulous, placed it on burning coals, when it
turned fiery red, but, on being removed, returned to its original
color, and all doubts as to its authenticity were dispelled.<a id="FNanchor_993_993" href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a>
When, in 1065, the pious Egelwin, Bishop of Durham,
miraculously discovered the relics of the holy martyr King
Oswyn, he gave the hair to Judith, wife of Tosti, Earl of
Northumberland, and she with all reverence placed it on a
raging fire, whence it was withdrawn, not only uninjured, but
marvellously increased in lustre, to the great edification of all
beholders.<a id="FNanchor_994_994" href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> A similar miracle attested the sanctity of King
Olaf the Saint, of Norway, when his hair was laid on a pan
of live coals, consecrated by Bishop Grimkel, to satisfy the
incredulity of Queen Alfifa.<a id="FNanchor_995_995" href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> Guibert de Nogent likewise relates
that, when his native town became honored with the
possession of an arm of St. Arnoul, the inhabitants, at first
doubting the genuineness of the precious relic, cast it into the
flames; when it vindicated its sanctity, not only by being fireproof,
but also by leaping briskly away from the coals, testimony
which was held to be incontrovertible.<a id="FNanchor_996_996" href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> The historian
of the monastery of Andres informs us that when in 1084 the
long-lost remains of the holy virgin Rotruda were miraculously
found, and Baldwin I., Count of Guisnes, desired to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
sacred treasure to his town of Guisnes, it refused to be removed
until he proposed to place it on a wagon and allow a
team of oxen to be divinely guided to the spot where the saint
desired to rest. This was accordingly done, and the oxen
carried the relics to a little chapel dedicated to St. Medard,
where steps were immediately taken to found an abbey. The
Seigneur of Andres, however, Baldwin Bochard, on whose
lands the chapel lay, foreseeing that a powerful monastery
would be a troublesome neighbor, and being an irreligious man,
circulated defamatory libels impugning the authenticity of the
relics, and finally persuaded Count Baldwin to have them
tested by the ordeal of fire. This was accordingly done, and
the genuineness of the holy remains was proved to the satisfaction
of all. Bochard and his descendants continued inveterately
hostile to St. Rotruda and her monks, but all,
without exception, were compelled, upon their death-beds, to
contribute a portion of their substance to her honor.<a id="FNanchor_997_997" href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> The
custom continued even until the sixteenth century was well
advanced. In the Jeronymite monastery of Valdebran in
Catalonia, a piece of the true cross bears inscription that its
genuineness was tested with fire by Archbishop Miralles on
October 2, 1530.<a id="FNanchor_998_998" href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a></p>

<p>The persistency of popular belief in this method of ascertaining
guilt or innocence is seen as recently as 1811, when a
Neapolitan noble, suspecting the chastity of his daughter, exposed
her to the ordeal of fire, from which she barely escaped
with her life.<a id="FNanchor_999_999" href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF COLD WATER.</small></h3>


<p>The cold-water ordeal (<i>judicium aquæ frigidæ</i>) differed
from most of its congeners in requiring a miracle to convict
the accused, as in the natural order of things he escaped.
The preliminary solemnities, fasting, prayer, and religious
rites, were similar to those already described; holy water
sometimes was given to the accused to drink; the reservoir of
water, or pond, was then exorcised with formulas exhibiting
the same combination of faith and impiety, and the accused,
bound with cords, was slowly lowered into it with a rope, to
prevent fraud if guilty, and to save him from drowning if innocent.<a id="FNanchor_1000_1000" href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a>
According to Anglo-Saxon rule, the length of rope
allowed under water was an ell and a half;<a id="FNanchor_1001_1001" href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> in one ritual it is
directed that a knot be made in the rope at a distance of a
long hair from the body of the accused, and if he sinks so as
to bring the knot down to the surface of the water, he is cleared;<a id="FNanchor_1002_1002" href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a>
but in process of time nice questions arose as to the precise
amount of submergence requisite for acquittal. Towards the
close of the twelfth century we find that some learned doctors
insisted that sinking to the very bottom of the water was indispensable;
others decided that if the whole person were
submerged it was sufficient; while others again reasoned that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
as the hair was an accident or excrement of the body, it had
the privilege of floating without convicting its owner, if the
rest of the body was satisfactorily covered.<a id="FNanchor_1003_1003" href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a></p>

<p>The basis of this ordeal was the belief, handed down from
the primitive Aryans, that the pure element would not receive
into its bosom any one stained with the crime of a false oath,
another form of which is seen in the ancient superstition that
the earth would eject the corpse of a criminal, and not allow
it to remain quietly interred. The manner in which the
church reconciled it to orthodoxy is clearly set forth by Hincmar:
“He who seeks to conceal the truth by a lie will not
sink in the waters over which the voice of the Lord hath
thundered; for the pure nature of water recognizes as impure,
and rejects as incompatible, human nature which, released
from falsehood by the waters of baptism, becomes again infected
with untruth.”<a id="FNanchor_1004_1004" href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> The baptism in the Jordan, the passage
of the Red Sea, and the crowning judgment of the Deluge,
were freely adduced in support of this theory, though these
latter were in direct contradiction to it; and the most figurative
language was boldly employed to give some show of probability
to the results expected. Thus, in the elaborate formula which
passes under the name of St. Dunstan, the prayer offered over
the water metaphorically adjures the Supreme Being—“Let
not the water receive the body of him who, released from the
weight of goodness, is upborne by the wind of iniquity!”<a id="FNanchor_1005_1005" href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></p>

<p>In India the ordeal of cold water became simply one of
endurance. The stream or pond was exorcised with the customary
Mantras:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thou O water dwellest in the interior of all things like a
witness. O water thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>
<p>“This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared
from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from
this perplexity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The patient stood in water up to his middle, facing the
East, caught hold of the thighs of a man “free from friendship
or hatred” and dived under, while simultaneously an
arrow of reed without a head was shot from a bow, 106
fingers’ breadth in length, and if he could remain under water
until the arrow was picked up and brought back, he gained his
cause, but if any portion of him could be seen above the surface
he was condemned. Yajnavalkya says this form of ordeal
was only used on the Sudras, or lowest caste, while the Ayeen
Akbery speaks of it as confined to the Vaisyas, or caste of
husbandmen and merchants. According to the Institutes of
Vishnu, it was not to be administered to the timid or those
affected with lung diseases, nor to those who gained their
living by the water, such as fishermen or boatmen, nor was it
allowed during the winter.<a id="FNanchor_1006_1006" href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a></p>

<p>Although, as we have seen (p. 268), the original cold-water
ordeal in India, as described by Manu, was precisely similar
to the European form, inasmuch as the guilty were expected to
float and the innocent to sink, and although in this shape it
prevailed everywhere throughout Europe, and its tenacity of
existence rendered it the last to disappear in the progress of
civilization, yet it does not make its appearance in any of the
earlier codes of the Barbarians. The first allusions to it occur
in the ninth century, and it was then so generally regarded as
a novelty that documents almost contemporaneous ascribe its
invention to the popes of that period. One story is that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Leo III. fled in 799 from his rebellious subjects to Charlemagne,
and returned to Rome under the latter’s protection,
the cold-water ordeal was introduced for the purpose of trying
the rebels or recovering a treasure which they had stolen.<a id="FNanchor_1007_1007" href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a>
Another version asserts that Eugenius II., who occupied the
pontifical throne from 824 to 827, invented it at the request of
Louis le Débonnaire, for the purpose of repressing the prevalent
sin of perjury.<a id="FNanchor_1008_1008" href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> It is further worthy of note that St.
Agobard, Archbishop of Lyons, in his treatises against the judgments
of God, written a few years before the accession of Eugenius,
while enumerating and describing the various methods
in use at that time, says nothing about that of cold water.<a id="FNanchor_1009_1009" href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a>
But for the evidence of its pre-existence in the East, we therefore
should be justified in assuming that it was an innovation
invented by the Church of the ninth century. That it was a
novelty is proved by the necessity felt to adduce authority for
its use.<a id="FNanchor_1010_1010" href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a></p>

<p>At first, its revival promised to be but temporary. Only
a few years after its introduction it was condemned by Louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
le Débonnaire at the Council of Worms, in 829; its use was
strictly prohibited, and the <i>missi dominici</i> were instructed to
see that the order was carried into effect, regulations which
were repeated by the Emperor Lothair, son of Louis.<a id="FNanchor_1011_1011" href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> These
interdictions were of little avail. The ordeal found favor
with popular superstition, and Hincmar contents himself with
remarking that the imperial prohibition was not confirmed by
the canons of authoritative councils.<a id="FNanchor_1012_1012" href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> The trial by cold water
spread rapidly throughout Europe, and by all the continental
races it was placed on an equal footing with the other forms
of ordeal. Among the Anglo-Saxons, indeed, its employment
has been called in question by some modern writers; but the
Dooms of Ethelstan sufficiently manifest its existence in England
before the Conquest, while as late as the close of the
twelfth century its use would seem to have been almost universal.
The assizes of Clarendon in 1166, confirmed at
Northampton in 1176, direct an inquest to be held in each
shire, and all who are indicted for murder, robbery, harboring
of malefactors, and other felonies are to be at once, without
further trial, passed through the water ordeal to determine
their guilt or innocence.<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013" href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a></p>

<p>As we have seen in the case of the iron ordeal, those of
water, both cold and hot, were variously described as patrician
or plebeian in different times and places. Thus Hincmar, in
the ninth century, alludes to the water ordeals as applicable
to persons of servile condition;<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014" href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> a constitution of the Emperor
St. Henry II., about A. D. 1000, in the Lombard law, has a
similar bearing;<a id="FNanchor_1015_1015" href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> in the eleventh century an Alsatian document,<a id="FNanchor_1016_1016" href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a>
in the twelfth Glanville’s treatise on the laws of Eng<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>land,<a id="FNanchor_1017_1017" href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a>
and in the thirteenth the laws of Scotland<a id="FNanchor_1018_1018" href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> all assume
the same position. This, however, was an innovation; for in
the earliest codes there was no such distinction, a provision in
the Salic law prescribing the <i>æneum</i>, or hot-water ordeal, even
for the Antrustions, who constituted the most favored class in
the state.<a id="FNanchor_1019_1019" href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> Nor even in later times was the rule by any means
absolute. In the tenth century, Sanche, Duke of Gascony,
desirous of founding the monastery of Saint Sever, claimed
some land which was necessary for the purpose, and being
resisted by the possessor, the title was decided by reference
to the cold-water ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020" href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> In 1027, Welf II., Count of
Altorf, ancestor of the great houses of Guelf in Italy and
England, having taken part in the revolt of Conrad the
Younger and Ernest of Suabia, was forced by the Emperor
Conrad the Salic to prove his innocence in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021" href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a>
About the same period Othlonus relates an incident in which
a man of noble birth accused of theft submitted himself to the
cold-water ordeal as a matter of course;<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022" href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> while in 1068, at
the Council of Vich, in Catalonia, held for the purpose of
enforcing the Truce of God, all persons accused of being
directly concerned in its violation are directed to be tried by
the cold-water ordeal in the Church of San Pedro, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
distinction of rank.<a id="FNanchor_1023_1023" href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> Nearly two centuries later, indeed,
when all the vulgar ordeals were falling into disuse, the water
ordeal was established among the nobles of Southern Germany,
as the mode of deciding doubtful claims on fiefs, and
in Northern Germany, for the settlement of conflicting titles
to land.<a id="FNanchor_1024_1024" href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a></p>

<p>In 1083, during the deadly struggle between the Empire
and the Papacy, as personified in Henry IV. and Hildebrand,
the imperialists related with great delight that some of the
leading prelates of the papal court submitted the cause of
their chief to this ordeal. After a three days’ fast, and
proper benediction of the water, they placed in it a boy to
represent the emperor, when to their horror he sank like a
stone. On referring the result to Hildebrand, he ordered a
repetition of the experiment, which was attended with the
same result. Then, throwing him in as a representative of
the pope, he obstinately floated during two trials, in spite of
all efforts to force him under the surface, and an oath was
exacted from all concerned to maintain inviolable secrecy as
to the unexpected result.<a id="FNanchor_1025_1025" href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most extensive instance of the application of
this form of ordeal was that proposed when the sacred vessels
were stolen from the cathedral church of Laon, as related by
a contemporary. At a council convened on the subject,
Master Anselm, the most learned doctor of the diocese, suggested
that, in imitation of the plan adopted by Joshua at
Jericho, a young child should be taken from each parish of
the town and be tried by immersion in consecrated water.
From each house of the parish which should be found guilty,
another child should be chosen to undergo the same process.
When the house of the criminal should thus be discovered,
all its inmates should be submitted to the ordeal, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
author of the sacrilege would thus be revealed. This plan
would have been adopted had not the frightened inhabitants
rushed to the bishop and insisted that the experiment should
commence with those whose access to the church gave them
the best opportunity to perpetrate the theft. Six of these
latter were accordingly selected, among whom was Anselm
himself. While in prison awaiting his trial, he caused himself
to be bound hand and foot and placed in a tub full of
water, in which he sank satisfactorily to the bottom, and
assured himself that he should escape. On the day of trial,
in the presence of an immense crowd, in the cathedral which
was chosen as the place of judgment, the first prisoner sank,
the second floated, the third sank, the fourth floated, the fifth
sank, and Anselm, who was the sixth, notwithstanding his
previous experiment, obstinately floated, and was condemned
with his accomplices, in spite of his earnest protestations of
innocence.<a id="FNanchor_1026_1026" href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a></p>

<p>Although the cold-water ordeal disappears from the statute-book
in civil and in ordinary criminal actions together with
its kindred modes of purgation, there was one class of cases
in which it maintained its hold upon the popular faith to a
much later period. These were the accusations of sorcery
and witchcraft which form so strange a feature of mediæval
and modern society; and its use for this purpose may apparently
be traced to various causes. For such crimes, drowning
was the punishment inflicted by the customs of the
Franks, as soon as they had lost the respect for individual
liberty of action which excluded personal punishments from
their original code;<a id="FNanchor_1027_1027" href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> and in addition to the general belief
that the pure element refused to receive those who were
tainted with crime, there was in this special class of cases a
widely spread superstition that adepts in sorcery and magic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
lost their specific gravity. Pliny mentions a race of enchanters
on the Euxine who were lighter than water—“eosdem
præterea non posse mergi ne veste quidam degravatos;”<a id="FNanchor_1028_1028" href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a>
and Stephanus Byzantinus describes the inhabitants of Thebe
as magicians who could kill with their breath, and floated
when thrown into the sea.<a id="FNanchor_1029_1029" href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> To the concurrence of these
notions we may attribute the fact that when the cold-water
ordeal was abandoned, in the thirteenth century, as a judicial
practice in ordinary cases, it still maintained its place as a
special mode of trying those unfortunate persons whom their
own folly, or the malice and fears of their neighbors, pointed
out as witches and sorcerers.<a id="FNanchor_1030_1030" href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> No less than a hundred years
after the efforts of Innocent III. had virtually put an end to
all the other forms of vulgar ordeals, we find Louis Hutin
ordering its employment in these cases.<a id="FNanchor_1031_1031" href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> At length, however,
it fell into desuetude, until the superstitious panic of witchcraft
which took possession of the popular mind caused its
revival in the second half of the sixteenth century. In 1487,
Sprenger, while treating of every possible detail concerning
witchcraft and its prosecution, and alluding to the red-hot
iron ordeal, makes no reference whatever to cold water or to
the faculty of floating possessed by witches, thus showing that
it had passed completely out of remembrance as a test in these
cases, both popularly and judicially.<a id="FNanchor_1032_1032" href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> In 1564, Wier discusses
it as though it were in ordinary use in Western Germany, and
mentions a recent case wherein a young girl falsely accused
was tested in this manner and floated, after which she was
tortured until the executioner himself wondered at her power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
of endurance. As no confession could be extracted, she was
discharged, which shows how little real confidence was reposed
in the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1033_1033" href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> Twenty years later, Scribonius, writing
in 1583, speaks of it as a novelty, but Neuwald assures us that
for eighteen years previous it had been generally employed
throughout Westphalia,<a id="FNanchor_1034_1034" href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> and in 1579 Bodin alludes to it as a
German fashion which, though he believes in its efficacy, he
yet condemns as savoring of magic.<a id="FNanchor_1035_1035" href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> The crime was one so
difficult to prove judicially, and the ordeal offered so ready
and so satisfactory a solution to the doubts of timid and conscientious
judges, that its resuscitation is not to be wondered
at. The professed demonographers, Bodin, Binsfeld, Godelmann,
and others, opposed its revival for various reasons, but
still it did not lack defenders. In 1583, Scribonius, on a visit
to Lemgow, saw three unfortunates burnt as witches, and
three other women, the same day, exposed to the ordeal on
the accusation of those executed. He describes them as
stripped naked, hands and feet bound together, right to left,
and then cast upon the river, where they floated like logs of
wood. Profoundly impressed with the miracle, in a letter to
the magistrates of Lemgow he expresses his warm approbation
of the proceeding, and endeavors to explain its rationale, and
to defend it against unbelievers. Sorcerers, from their intercourse
with Satan, partake of his nature; he resides within
them, and their human attributes become altered to his; he is
an imponderable spirit of air, and therefore they likewise
become lighter than water. Two years later, Hermann Neuwald
published a tract in answer to this, gravely confuting the
arguments advanced by Scribonius, who, in 1588, returned
to the attack with a larger and more elaborate treatise in favor
of the ordeal. Shortly after this, Bishop Binsfeld, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
exhaustive work on witchcraft, states that the process was
one in common use throughout Westphalia, and occasionally
employed in the Rhinelands. He condemns it, however, on
the score of superstition, and the prohibition of all ordeals by
the popes, and concludes that any judge making use of it, or
any one believing in it, is guilty of mortal sin. Rejecting
the explanation of Scribonius, he argues that the floating of
the witch is caused by the direct interposition of the Devil
himself, who is willing to sacrifice a follower occasionally in
order to damn the souls of those who participate in a practice
condemned by the Church.<a id="FNanchor_1036_1036" href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> Wier, who denied witchcraft,
while believing in the active interposition of the Devil, argues
likewise that those who float are borne up by demons, but he
attributes it to their desire to confirm the popular illusions
concerning witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_1037_1037" href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> Another demonographer of the
period, Godelmann, does not hesitate to say that any judge
resorting to this mode of proof rendered himself liable to a
retaliatory action; and he substantiates his opinion as to the
worthlessness of the trial by a case within his own experience.
In 1588 he was travelling from Prussia to Livonia, when at
the castle of a great potentate his host happened to mention
that he had condemned a most wicked witch to be
burnt the next day. Godelmann, desirous to know whether
the proof could be relied on, asked whether the water ordeal
had been tried, and on being answered in the negative, urged
the experiment. His request was granted, and the witch sank
like a stone. Subsequently the noble wrote to him that he
had tried it with six other indubitable witches, and that it had
failed with all, showing that it was a false indication, which
might deceive incautious judges.<a id="FNanchor_1038_1038" href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> Oldenkop, on the other
hand, relates that he was present when some suspected women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
were tried in this manner, who all floated, after which one of
the spectators, wholly innocent of the crime, to satisfy the
curiosity of some nobles who were present, allowed himself
for hire to be tied and thrown in, when he likewise floated
and could not be made to sink by all the efforts of the officiating
executioner.<a id="FNanchor_1039_1039" href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> In 1594, a more authoritative combatant
entered the arena—Jacob Rickius, a learned jurisconsult of
Cologne, who, as judge in the court of Bonn, had ample
opportunity of considering the question and of putting his
convictions into practice. He describes vividly the perplexities
of the judges hesitating between the enormity of the crime
and the worthlessness of the evidence, and his elaborate discussions
of all the arguments in favor of the ordeal may be
condensed into this: that the offence is so difficult of proof
that there is no other certain evidence than the ordeal; that
without it we should be destitute of absolute proof, which
would be an admission of the superiority of the Devil over
God, and that anything would be preferable to such a conclusion.
He states that he never administered it when the
evidence without it was sufficient for conviction, nor when
there was not enough other proof to justify the use of torture;
and that in all cases it was employed as a prelude to torture—“præparandum
et muniendum torturæ viam”—the latter
being frequently powerless in consequence of diabolical influences.
The deplorable examples which he details with
much complacency as irrefragable proofs of his positions
show how frequent and how murderous were the cases of its
employment, but would occupy too much space for recapitulation
here; while the learning displayed in his constant citations
from the Scriptures, the Fathers, the Roman and the
Canon Law, is in curious contrast with the fatuous cruelty of
his acts and doctrines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>In France, the central power had to be invoked to put an
end to the atrocity of such proceedings. In 1588, an appeal
was taken to the supreme tribunal from a sentence pronounced
by a Champenois court, ordering a prisoner to undergo the
experiment, and the Parlement, in December, 1601, registered
a formal decree against the practice; an order which it found
necessary to repeat, August 10, 1641.<a id="FNanchor_1040_1040" href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> That this latter was
not uncalled for, we may assume from the testimony of Jerôme
Bignon, who, writing nearly at the same time, says that, to
his own knowledge, within a few years, judges were in the
habit of elucidating doubtful cases in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_1041_1041" href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> In England,
James I. gratified at once his conceit and his superstition
by eulogizing the ordeal as an infallible proof in such cases.
His argument was the old one, which pronounced that the pure
element would not receive those who had renounced the
privileges of the water of baptism,<a id="FNanchor_1042_1042" href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> and his authority no doubt
gave encouragement to innumerable judicial murders. In
Scotland, indeed, the indecency of stripping women naked
for the immersion was avoided by wrapping them up in a
sheet before binding the thumbs and toes together, but a
portion of the Bay of St. Andrews is still called the “Witch
Pool,” from its use in the trial of these unfortunates.<a id="FNanchor_1043_1043" href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a></p>

<p>How slowly the belief was eradicated from the minds of
even the educated and enlightened may be seen in a learned
inaugural thesis presented by J. P. Lang, in 1661, for the
Licentiate of Laws in the University of Bâle, in which, dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>cussing
incidentally the question of the cold-water ordeal for
witches, he concludes that perhaps it is better to abstain from
it, though he cannot question its efficaciousness as a means of
investigation.<a id="FNanchor_1044_1044" href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> In 1662, N. Brant, in a similar thesis, offered
at Giessen, speaks of it as used in some places, chiefly in
Westphalia, and argues against it on the ground of its uncertainty.<a id="FNanchor_1045_1045" href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a>
P. Burgmeister, in a thesis presented at Ulm in 1680,
speaks of the practice as still continued in Westphalia, and
that it was defended by many learned men, from whose
opinions he dissents; among them was Hermann Conring, one
of the most distinguished scholars of the time, who argued
that if prayers and oaths could obtain the divine interposition,
it could reasonably be expected in judicial cases of importance.<a id="FNanchor_1046_1046" href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a>
Towards the close of the century it was frequently practised
in Burgundy, not as a judicial process, but when persons
popularly reputed as sorcerers desired to free themselves from
the damaging imputation. In these cases they are frequently
reported as floating in spite of repeated efforts to submerge
them, and though this evidence of guilt did not lead to a
formal trial they would have to abandon the neighborhood.
A notarial act of June 5, 1696, records such a trial at Montigny-le-Roi,
when six persons offered themselves to the ordeal in the
River Senin; two sank and four floated for about half an hour,
with hands and feet tied.<a id="FNanchor_1047_1047" href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> F. M. Brahm, in 1701, alludes to
the ordeal as no longer in use;<a id="FNanchor_1048_1048" href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> but in 1714, J. C. Nehring
describes it as nearly, though not quite obsolete, and considers
it worthy of an elaborate discussion. He disapproves of it,
though he records a case which occurred a few years previously,
in which a woman accused of witchcraft managed to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
from her chains, and went into the water to try herself, and
could not be submerged. Notwithstanding this he declares
that even when a prisoner demands the ordeal, the judge who
grants it is guilty of mortal sin, for the Devil often promises
witches to save them in this manner, and, though he very
rarely keeps his promise, still he thus succeeds in retaining
men in superstitious observances. The success of the ordeal
thus is uncertain, and his conclusion is that laws must be made
for the generality of cases, and not for exceptional ones.<a id="FNanchor_1049_1049" href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> In
1730 thirteen persons were exposed to the cold-water ordeal at
Szegedin, in Hungary, and though their guilt was proved by it,
any remaining doubts were settled by submitting them to the
balance;<a id="FNanchor_1050_1050" href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> and five years later Ephraim Gerhardt alludes to it
as everywhere in daily use in such cases.<a id="FNanchor_1051_1051" href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> Even in the middle
of the century, the learned and pious Muratori affirms his
reverent belief in the miraculous convictions recorded by the
mediæval writers as wrought in this manner by the judgment
of God; and he further informs us that it was common in his
time throughout Transylvania, where witches were very
numerous;<a id="FNanchor_1052_1052" href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> while in West Prussia, as late as 1745, the Synod
of Culm describes it as a popular abuse in frequent use, and
stringently forbids it for the future.<a id="FNanchor_1053_1053" href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></p>

<p>Although, within the last hundred years, the cold-water
ordeal has disappeared from the authorized legal procedures
of Europe, still the popular mind has not as yet altogether
overcome the superstitions and prejudices of so many ages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
and occasionally in some benighted spot a case occurs to
show us that mediæval ignorance and brutality still linger
amid the triumphs of modern civilization. In 1815 and 1816,
Belgium was disgraced by trials of the kind performed on unfortunates
suspected of witchcraft;<a id="FNanchor_1054_1054" href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> and in 1836, the populace
of Hela, near Dantzic, twice plunged into the sea an old
woman reputed to be a sorceress, and as the miserable creature
persisted in rising to the surface, she was pronounced guilty,
and was beaten to death.<a id="FNanchor_1055_1055" href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> Even in England it is not many
years since a party of credulous people were prosecuted for
employing the water ordeal in the trial of a woman whom
they believed to be a witch.<a id="FNanchor_1056_1056" href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></p>

<p>In Montenegro and Herzegovina the practice continued till
the middle of the present century. Any unusual mortality
of children was attributed to sorcery by women: in such
cases the head of a village assembled all the men and exhorted
them to bring next morning their wives and mothers to the
nearest water—a lake or a river, or if necessary a well. The
women were then examined one by one, by passing a rope
under the arms and tossing them in, without divesting them
of their clothes. Those who were so ill-advised as not to
sink were pronounced guilty, and were liable to lapidation if
they would not swear to abandon their evil practices. The
belief even extended to the dominant Turks who, in 1857 at
Trebinje, compelled the Christians to bring all their women
to the river and cast them in. Buoyed up by their garments
seven floated, and these were only saved from stoning by the
archimandrite Eustache, who administered to them a solemn
oath of abstinence from witchcraft. Austrian domination has
rendered all such proceedings unlawful of late years, but in
the remoter districts they are said to be still occasionally
practised.<a id="FNanchor_1057_1057" href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p>Perhaps we may class as a remnant of this superstition a
custom described by a modern traveller as universal in Southern
Russia. When a theft is committed in a household, the
servants are assembled, and a sorceress, or <i>vorogeia</i>, is sent
for. Dread of what is to follow generally extorts a confession
from the guilty party without further proceedings, but if not,
the <i>vorogeia</i> places on the table a vase of water and rolls up
as many little balls of bread as there are suspected persons
present. Then, taking one of the balls, she addresses the
nearest servant—“If you have committed the theft, this ball
will sink to the bottom of the vase, as will your soul in Hell;
but if you are innocent, it will float on the water.” The truth
or falsehood of this assertion is never tested, for the criminal
invariably confesses before his turn arrives to undergo the
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1058_1058" href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF THE BALANCE.</small></h3>


<p>We have seen above that a belief existed that persons guilty
of sorcery lost their specific gravity, and this superstition
naturally led to the use of the balance in the effort to discover
and punish the crime of witchcraft, which all experts assure
us was the most difficult of all offences on which to obtain
evidence. The trial by balance, however, was not a European
invention. Like nearly all the other ordeals, it can be traced
back to India, where, at least as early as the time of the Institutes
of Vishnu, it was in common use. It is described there
as reserved for women, children, old men, invalids, the blind,
the lame, and the privileged Brahman caste, and not to be
undertaken when a wind was blowing. After proper ceremonies
the patient was placed in one scale, with an equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
weight to counterbalance him in the other, and the nicety of
the operation is shown by the prescription that the beam must
have a groove with water in it, evidently for the purpose of
detecting the slightest deflection either way. The accused
then descended and the judge addressed the customary adjuration
to the balance:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thou, O balance, art called by the same name as holy
law (dharma); thou, O balance, knowest what mortals do not
comprehend.</p>

<p>“This man, arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee.
Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the accused was replaced in the scale, and if he were
found to be lighter than before he was acquitted. If the scale
broke, the trial was to be repeated.<a id="FNanchor_1059_1059" href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a></p>

<p>It will be seen here that lightness was an evidence of innocence,
but in Europe the ordeal was reversed in consequence
of the belief that sorcerers became lighter than water.
Rickius, writing in 1594, speaks of this mode of trial being
commonly used in many places in witchcraft cases, and gravely
assures us that very large and fat women had been found to
weigh only thirteen or fifteen pounds;<a id="FNanchor_1060_1060" href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> but even this will
scarcely explain the modification of the process as employed
in some places, which consisted in putting the accused in one
scale and a Bible in the other.<a id="FNanchor_1061_1061" href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> Kœnigswarter assures us that
the scales formerly used on these occasions are still to be seen
at Oudewater in Holland.<a id="FNanchor_1062_1062" href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> In the case already referred to as
occurring July 30, 1728, at Szegedin in Hungary, thirteen persons,
six men and seven women, were burnt alive for witch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>craft,
whose guilt had been proved, first by the cold-water
ordeal and then by that of the balance. We are told that a
large and fat woman weighed only one and a half drachms and
her husband five drachms and the rest varied from a pennyweight
to three drachms and under. One of the victims was
a man of 82, a local judge, who had previously borne an unblemished
character.<a id="FNanchor_1063_1063" href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a> The use of the Bible as a counterpoise
is on record even as lately as the year 1759, at Aylesbury in
England, where one Susannah Haynokes, accused of witchcraft,
was formally weighed against the Bible in the parish
church.<a id="FNanchor_1064_1064" href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF THE CROSS.</small></h3>


<p>The ordeal of the cross (<i>judicium crucis, stare ad crucem</i>)
was one of simple endurance and differed from all its congeners,
except the duel, in being bilateral. The plaintiff and
defendant, after appropriate religious ceremonies and preparation,
stood with uplifted arms before a cross, while divine service
was performed, victory being adjudged to the one who
was able longest to maintain his position. An ancient formula
for judgments obtained in this manner in cases of disputed
titles to land prescribes the term of forty-two nights for the
trial.<a id="FNanchor_1065_1065" href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> It doubtless originated in the use of this exercise by
the Church both as a punishment and as a penance.<a id="FNanchor_1066_1066" href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> Of its
use as an ordeal the earliest instance which I have observed
occurs in a Capitulary of Pepin le Bref, in 752, where it is
prescribed in cases of application by a wife for dissolution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1067_1067" href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> Charlemagne appears to have regarded it with
much favor, for he not only frequently refers to it in his edicts,
but, when dividing his mighty empire, in 806, he directs that
all territorial disputes which may arise in the future between
his sons shall be settled in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_1068_1068" href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a> An example occurring
during his reign shows the details of the process. A controversy
between the bishop and citizens of Verona, relative
to the building of certain walls, was referred to the decision
of the cross. Two young ecclesiastics, selected as champions,
stood before the sacred emblem from the commencement of
mass; at the middle of the Passion, Aregaus, who represented
the citizens, fell lifeless to the ground, while his
antagonist, Pacificus, held out triumphantly to the end, and
the bishop gained his cause, as ecclesiastics were wont to do.<a id="FNanchor_1069_1069" href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a></p>

<p>When a defeated pleader desired to discredit his own compurgators,
he had the right to accuse them of perjury, and the
question was then decided by this process.<a id="FNanchor_1070_1070" href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> In a similar
spirit, witnesses too infirm to undergo the battle-trial, by
which in the regular process of law they were bound to substantiate
their testimony, were allowed, by a Capitulary of
816, to select the ordeal of the cross, with the further privilege,
in cases of extreme debility, of substituting a relative
or other champion, whose robustness promised an easier task
for the Divine interference.<a id="FNanchor_1071_1071" href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></p>

<p>A slight variation of this form of ordeal consisted in standing
with the arms extended in the form of a cross, while
certain portions of the service were recited. In this manner
St. Lioba, Abbess of Bischoffsheim, triumphantly vindicated
the purity of her flock, and traced out the offender, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
the reputation of her convent was imperilled by the discovery
of a new-born child drowned in a neighboring pond.<a id="FNanchor_1072_1072" href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a></p>

<p>The sensitive piety of Louis le Débonnaire was shocked at
this use of the cross, as tending to bring the Christian symbol
into contempt, and in 816, soon after the death of Charlemagne,
he prohibited its continuance, at the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle;<a id="FNanchor_1073_1073" href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a>
an order which was repeated by his son, the
Emperor Lothair.<a id="FNanchor_1074_1074" href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> Baluze, however, considers, with apparent
reason, that this command was respected only in the
Rhenish provinces and in Italy, from the fact that the manuscripts
of the Capitularies belonging to those regions omit the
references to the ordeal of the cross, which are retained in the
copies used in the other territories of the Frankish empire.<a id="FNanchor_1075_1075" href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a>
Louis himself would seem at length to have changed his
opinion; for, in the final division of his succession between
his sons, he repeats the direction of Charlemagne as regards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
the settlement of disputed boundaries.<a id="FNanchor_1076_1076" href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> The procedure, however,
appears to have soon lost its popularity, and indeed
never to have obtained the wide and deeply-seated hold on the
veneration of the people enjoyed by the other forms of ordeal,
though there is extant a formula for confirming disputed titles
to real estate decided in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_1077_1077" href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> We see little of it at
later periods, except the trace it has left in the proverbial allusion
to an <i>experimentum crucis</i>.</p>

<p>In India a cognate mode is adopted by the people of
Ramgur to settle questions of disputed boundaries between
villages. When agreement by argument or referees is found
impossible, each community chooses a champion, and the two
stand with one leg buried in the earth until weariness or the
bites of insects cause one of them to yield, when the territory
in litigation is adjudged to the village of the victor.<a id="FNanchor_1078_1078" href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></p>

<small>THE CORSNÆD.</small></h3>


<p>The ordeal of consecrated bread or cheese (<i>judicium offæ,
panis conjuratio, pabulum probationis</i>, the <i>corsnæd</i> of the
Anglo-Saxons) was administered by presenting to the accused
a piece of bread (generally of barley) or of cheese, about an
ounce in weight,<a id="FNanchor_1079_1079" href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> over which prayers and adjurations had been
pronounced. After appropriate religious ceremonies, including
the communion, the morsel was eaten, the event being
determined by the ability of the accused to swallow it. This
depended of course on the imagination, and we can readily
understand how, in those times of faith, the impressive ob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>servances
which accompanied the ordeal would affect the
criminal, who, conscious of guilt, stood up at the altar, took
the sacrament, and pledged his salvation on the truth of his
oath. The mode by which a conviction was expected may be
gathered from the forms of the exorcism employed, of which
a number have been preserved.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“O Lord Jesus Christ, ... grant, we pray thee, by thy
holy name, that he who is guilty of this crime in thought or
in deed, when this creature of sanctified bread is presented
to him for the proving of the truth, let his throat be narrowed,
and in thy name let it be rejected rather than devoured. And
let not the spirit of the Devil prevail in this to subvert the
judgment by false appearances. But he who is guilty of this
crime, let him, chiefly by virtue of the body and blood of our
Lord which he has received in communion, when he takes the
consecrated bread or cheese tremble, and grow pale in trembling,
and shake in all his limbs; and let the innocent quietly
and healthfully, with all ease, chew and swallow this morsel of
bread or cheese, crossed in thy holy name, that all may know
that thou art the just Judge,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_1080_1080" href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And even more forcible in its devout impiety is the following:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“O God Most High, who dwellest in Heaven, who through
thy Trinity and Majesty hast thy just angels, send, O Lord,
thy Angel Gabriel to stick in the throat of those who have
committed this theft, that they may neither chew nor swallow
this bread and cheese created by Thee. I invoke the patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with twelve thousand
Angels and Archangels. I invoke the four evangelists, Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John. I invoke Moses and Aaron,
who divided the sea. That they may bind to their throats the
tongues of the men who have committed this theft, or consented
thereto. If they taste this bread and cheese created
by Thee, may they tremble like a trembling tree, and have no
rest, nor keep the bread and cheese in their mouths; that all
may know Thou art the Lord, and there is none other but
Thee!”<a id="FNanchor_1081_1081" href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>As the efficiency of the ordeal depended upon the effect
produced on the imagination of the patient clerical ingenuity
exhausted itself in devising tremendous and awe-inspiring exorcisms.
One like the following, for instance, could hardly
fail to constrict the throat of the most hardened sinner:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I exorcise thee, accursed and most filthy dragon, basilisk,
evil serpent, by the Word of truth, by almighty God, by the
spotless Lamb begotten of the Highest, conceived of the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, whose coming Gabriel announced,
whom when John saw he cried aloud This is the Son
of the living God, that thou may’st have no power over this
bread or cheese, but that he who committed this theft may
eat in trembling and vomit forth by Thy command, Holy
Father and Lord, almighty and eternal God.... May he
who has stolen these things or is an accomplice in this, may
his throat and his tongue and his jaws be narrowed and constricted
so that he cannot chew this bread or cheese, by the
Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, by the tremendous
Day of Judgment, by the four Evangels, by the twelve Apostles,
by the four and twenty elders who daily praise and worship
Thee, by that Redeemer who deigned for our sins to
stretch his hands upon the cross, that he who stole these
things cannot chew this bread or cheese save with a swelled
mouth and froth and tears, by the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom is honor and glory forever and forever.”<a id="FNanchor_1082_1082" href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Yet Boccaccio’s story of Calendrino, which turns upon the
mixing of aloes with the bread administered in the <i>corsnæd</i>,
perhaps affords a more rationalistic explanation of the expected
miracle.<a id="FNanchor_1083_1083" href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a></p>

<p>A striking illustration of the superstitions connected with
this usage is found in the story related by most of the English
chroniclers concerning the death of Godwin, Duke of Kent,
father of King Harold, and in his day the king-maker of England.
As he was dining with his royal son-in-law, Edward
the Confessor, some trivial circumstance caused the king to
repeat an old accusation that his brother Alfred had met his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
death at Godwin’s hands. The old but fiery duke, seizing a
piece of bread, exclaimed: “May God cause this morsel to
choke me if I am guilty in thought or in deed of this crime!”
Then the king took the bread and blessed it, and Godwin,
putting it in his mouth, was suffocated by it, and fell dead.<a id="FNanchor_1084_1084" href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a>
A poetical life of Edward the Confessor, written in the
thirteenth century, gives a graphic picture of the death of the
duke and the vengeful triumph of the king:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>This form of ordeal never obtained the extended influence
which characterized some of the other modes, and it seems
to have been chiefly confined to the populations allied to the
Saxon race. In England, before the Conquest, it was enjoined
on the lower orders of the clergy who were unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
procure conjurators,<a id="FNanchor_1086_1086" href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> and it may be considered as a plebeian
mode of trial, rarely rising into historical importance. Its
vitality, however, is demonstrated by the fact that Lindenbruck,
writing in 1613, states that it was then still in frequent
use.<a id="FNanchor_1087_1087" href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a></p>

<p>Aimoin relates a story which, though in no sense judicial,
presents us with a development of the same superstition. A
certain renowned knight named Arnustus unjustly occupied
lands belonging to the Benedictine Abbey of Fleury. Dining
at the usurped property one day, and boasting of his contempt
for the complaints of the holy monks, he took a pear
and exclaimed—“I call this pear to witness that before the
year is out I will give them ample cause for grumbling.”
Choking with the first morsel, he was carried speechless to
bed, and miserably perished unhouselled, a warning to evildoers
not to tempt too far the patience of St. Benedict.<a id="FNanchor_1088_1088" href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a>
Stories such as this are by no means uncommon, and are not
without interest as a portion of the armory by which the
clergy defended themselves against their unquiet neighbors.
Of kindred nature is an occurrence related about the year
1090, when Duke Henry of Limburg was involved in a quarrel
with Engilbert, Archbishop of Trèves, and treated with
contempt the excommunication and anathema inflicted upon
him. Joking upon the subject with his followers one day at
dinner, he tossed a fragment of food to his dog, remarking
that if the animal ate it, they need not feel apprehensive of
the episcopal curse. The dog refused the tempting morsel,
though he manifested his hunger by eagerly devouring food
given him by another hand, and the duke, by the advice of
his counsellors, lost no time in reconciling himself with his
ghostly adversary. This is the more remarkable, as Engilbert
himself was under excommunication by Gregory VII.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
being a stanch imperialist, who had received his see from
Henry IV., and his pallium from the antipope Guiberto.<a id="FNanchor_1089_1089" href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a></p>

<p>In India, this ordeal is performed with a kind of rice called
<i>sathee</i>, prepared with various incantations. The person on
trial eats it, with his face to the East, and then spits upon a
peepul leaf. “If the saliva is mixed with blood, or the
corners of his mouth swell, or he trembles, he is declared to
be a liar.”<a id="FNanchor_1090_1090" href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> A slightly different form is described for cases in
which several persons are suspected of theft. The consecrated
rice is administered to them all, is chewed lightly, and
then spit out upon a peepul leaf. If any one ejects it either
dry or tinged with blood, he is adjudged guilty.<a id="FNanchor_1091_1091" href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a></p>

<p>Based on the same theory is a ceremony performed by the
pre-Aryan hill-tribes of Rajmahal, when swearing judges into
office preparatory to the trial of a case. In this a pinch of
salt is placed upon a <i>tulwar</i> or scimitar, and held over the
mouth of the judge, to whom is addressed the adjuration,
“If thou decidest contrary to thy judgment and falsely, may
this salt be thy death!” The judge repeats the formula, and
the salt is washed with water into his mouth.<a id="FNanchor_1092_1092" href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a></p>

<small>THE EUCHARIST AS AN ORDEAL.</small></h3>


<p>From ancient times in India there has been in common use
an ordeal known as <i>cosha</i>, consisting of water in which an
idol has been washed. The priest celebrates solemn rites “to
some tremendous deity,” such as Durga or the Adityas, whose
image is then bathed in water. Three handfuls of this water
are then drunk by the accused, and if within fourteen days he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
is not visited with some dreadful calamity from the act of the
deity or of the king, “he must indubitably be acquitted.”<a id="FNanchor_1093_1093" href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a></p>

<p>In adapting the ordeal system to Christianity the natural
substitute for this pagan ceremony was the administration of
the Eucharist. This, indeed, formed a portion of the preparatory
rites in all the judgments of God, the Host being
given with the awful adjuration, “May this body and blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ be a judgment to thee this day!”
The apostle had said that “he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
eateth and drinketh damnation to himself” (I. <i>Corinth.</i>
xi. 28, 29), and the pious veneration of the age
accepted the admonition literally. Mediæval literature is
full of legends showing the miraculous power of the Eucharist
in bringing sinners to repentance and exposure, even
without any special invocation; and the absolute belief in
this fetishism, even by the irreligious, is fairly illustrated by
the case of a dissolute priest of Zurich, in the fourteenth
century. An habitual drunkard, gambler, and fornicator, he
yet celebrated mass daily with exemplary regularity. On
being warned of the dangers to which he was thus exposing
himself in partaking of the Eucharist, he at length confessed
that he never consecrated the host, but that he carried about
him a small round piece of wood, resembling the holy wafer,
which he exhibited to the people and passed it off for the
body of Christ. The honest chronicler fairly explodes with
indignation in relating the subterfuge, and assures us that
while the priest succeeded in escaping one danger he fell into
a much greater, as he was the cause of leading his flock into
the unpardonable sin of idolatry. Apparently his parishioners
thought so too, for though they had patiently endured the
scandals of his daily life, as soon as this trick became known
they drove him away unceremoniously.<a id="FNanchor_1094_1094" href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> What this pastor,
but for his ingenious device, might have reasonably dreaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
is to be learned from the story of a volunteer miracle vouchsafed
to an unchaste priest at Lindisfarne, who being suddenly
summoned to celebrate mass without having had time to
purify himself, when he came to partake of the sacramental
cup, saw the wine change to an exceeding blackness. After
some hesitation he took it, and found it bitter to the last
degree. Hurrying to his bishop, he confessed his sin, underwent
penance, and reformed his life.<a id="FNanchor_1095_1095" href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> Even more edifying
was a case related as happening in France about the year
1200. A priest yielded to the temptation of the flesh immediately
before celebrating mass on Christmas eve, when, after
consecrating the body and blood, and before he could touch
them with his polluted lips, a white dove appeared which
drank the wine and carried off the wafer. It happened that
he could find no one to replace him during the ceremonies of
the festival, and, though appalled by the miracle, he could
not refuse to perform his functions without exposure, so that
a second and a third time he went through the canon with
the same result. Finally he applied to an abbot, and confessed
his sin with due contrition. The abbot postponed
inflicting penance until the priest should officiate again, when
the dove reappeared, bearing in its beak the three wafers, and
returning to the chalice all the wine it had taken. Filled
with rejoicing at this evidence that his contrition was accepted,
the priest cheerfully undertook three years’ pilgrimage
in the Holy Land, prescribed for him by the abbot, and on
his return entered a convent.<a id="FNanchor_1096_1096" href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a></p>

<p>A still more striking manifestation of the interposition of
God by means of the Eucharist to vindicate innocence is to
be found in the case of Erkenbald de Burban, a noble of
Flanders, who was renowned for his inflexible administration
of justice. While lying on his death-bed, his favorite nephew
and heir endeavored to violate one of the maidens of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
castle. Erkenbald ordered him to be hanged, but his followers
were afraid to execute the sentence; so, when after
an interval, the youth approached his uncle for a reconciliation,
the latter put his arm affectionately round his neck, and
drove a dagger up to the hilt in his throat. When Erkenbald
made his final confession preparatory to the last sacrament, he
refused to include this deed among his sins, claiming that it
was an act of righteousness, and his bishop consequently refused
to administer the Host. The dying man obdurately
allowed him to depart; then ordering him recalled, asked
him to see whether he had the wafer in his pyx. On the
latter being opened it was found empty, and Erkenbald exhibited
it to him in his mouth. The Eucharist which man
had refused, God had ministered to the righteous judge.<a id="FNanchor_1097_1097" href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a></p>

<p>It is, therefore, easy to understand the superstition of the
ages of faith which believed that, when the consecrated wafer
was offered under appropriate adjurations, the guilty could
not receive it; or that, if it were taken, immediate convulsions
and speedy death, or some other miraculous manifestation
would ensue, thus constituting its administration for such
purposes a regular and recognized form of ordeal. This is
well illustrated by a form of exorcism preserved by Mansi:
“We humbly pray thy Infinite Majesty that this priest, if
guilty of the accusation, shall not be able to receive this venerated
body of thy Son, crucified for the salvation of all, and
that what should be the remedy of all evil shall prove to him
hurtful, full of grief and suffering, bearing with it all sorrow
and bitterness.”<a id="FNanchor_1098_1098" href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> What might be expected under such circumstances
is elucidated by a case which occurred in the
early part of the eleventh century, as reported by the contemporary
Rodolphus Glaber, in which a monk, condemned to
undergo the trial, boldly received the sacrament, when the
Host, indignant at its lodgment in the body of so perjured a
criminal, immediately slipped out at the navel, white and pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
as before, to the immense consternation of the accused, who
forthwith confessed his crime.<a id="FNanchor_1099_1099" href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a></p>

<p>The antiquity of this mode of trial is shown in its employment
by Cautinus, Bishop of Auvergne, towards the close of
the sixth century. A certain Count Eulalius was popularly
accused of parricide, whereupon he was suspended from communion.
On his complaining of thus being punished without
a trial, the bishop administered the sacrament under the
customary adjuration, and Eulalius, taking it without harm,
was relieved from the imputation.<a id="FNanchor_1100_1100" href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> It was usually, however,
a sacerdotal form of purgation, as is shown by the Anglo-Saxon
laws,<a id="FNanchor_1101_1101" href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> and by the canons of the council of Worms in
868, embodied in the <i>Decretum</i> of Gratian.<a id="FNanchor_1102_1102" href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> Thus, in 941,
Frederic, Archbishop of Mainz, publicly submitted to an
ordeal of this kind, to clear himself of the suspicion of having
taken part in an unsuccessful rebellion of Henry, Duke of
Bavaria, against his brother, Otho the Great.<a id="FNanchor_1103_1103" href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> After the death
of Henry, slander assailed the fame of his widow, Juthita, on
account of an alleged intimacy between her and Abraham,
Bishop of Freisingen. When she, too, died, the bishop performed
her funeral rites, and, pausing in the mass, he addressed
the congregation: “If she was guilty of that whereof
she was accused, may the Omnipotent Father cause the body
and blood of the Son to be my condemnation to just perdition,
and perpetual salvation to her soul!”—after which he
took the sacrament unharmed, and the people acknowledged
the falsity of their belief.<a id="FNanchor_1104_1104" href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> In 1050, Subico, Bishop of Speyer,
sought to clear himself of a similar accusation at the council
of Mainz, in the same manner, when according to one version
he succeeded, while another less friendly account assures us that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
his jaw became paralyzed in the very act, and remained so till
the day of his death.<a id="FNanchor_1105_1105" href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking instance recorded of its administration
was, however, in a secular matter, when in 869 it
closed the unhappy controversy between King Lothair and
his wives, to which reference has been already made. To
reconcile himself to the Church, Lothair took a solemn oath
before Adrian II. that he had obeyed the ecclesiastical mandates
in maintaining a complete separation from his pseudo-wife
Waldrada, after which the pontiff admitted him to
communion, under an adjuration that it should prove the test
of his truthfulness. Lothair did not shrink from the ordeal,
nor did his nobles, to whom it was given on their declaring
that they had not abetted the designs of the concubine; but
leaving Rome immediately afterwards, the royal <i>cortége</i> was
stopped at Piacenza by a sudden epidemic which broke out
among the courtiers, and there Lothair died, August 8th, with
nearly all of his followers—an awful example held out by the
worthy chroniclers as a warning to future generations.<a id="FNanchor_1106_1106" href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></p>

<p>In this degradation of the Host to the level of daily life
there was a profanity repugnant to a reverential mind, and we
are therefore not surprised to find King Robert the Pious, in
the early part of the eleventh century, raising his voice against
its judicial use, and threatening to degrade the Archbishop of
Sens for employing it in this manner, especially as his biographer
informs us that the custom was daily growing in favor.<a id="FNanchor_1107_1107" href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a>
Robert’s example was soon afterwards imitated by Alexander
II., whose pontificate lasted from 1061 to 1073.<a id="FNanchor_1108_1108" href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> The next
pope, however, the impetuous Hildebrand, made use of it on
a memorable occasion. When, in 1077, the Emperor Henry
IV. had endured the depths of humiliation before the castle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
gate of Canossa, and had at length purchased peace by submitting
to the exactions demanded of him, the excommunication
under which he had lain was removed in the chapel.
Then Gregory, referring to the crimes imputed to himself by
the emperor’s partisans, said that he could easily refute them
by abundant witnesses; “but lest I should seem to rely rather
on human than on divine testimony, and that I may remove
from the minds of all, by immediate satisfaction, every scruple,
behold this body of our Lord which I am about to take. Let
it be to me this day a test of my innocence, and may the
Omnipotent God this day by his judgment absolve me of the
accusations if I am innocent, or let me perish by sudden death
if guilty!” Swallowing the wafer, he turned to the emperor,
and demanded of him the same refutation of the charges urged
against him by the German princes. Appalled by this unexpected
trial, Henry in an agony of fear evaded it, and consulted
hurriedly with his councillors how to escape the awful test,
which he finally declined on the ground of the absence of
both his friends and his enemies, without whose presence the
result would establish nothing.<a id="FNanchor_1109_1109" href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> In estimating the mingled
power of imagination and conscience which rendered the proposal
insupportable to the emperor, we must allow for the influence
which a man like Hildebrand with voice and eye can
exert over those whom he wishes to impress. At an earlier
stage of his career, in 1055, he improvised a very effective
species of ordeal, when presiding as papal legate at the Council
of Lyons, assembled for the repression of simony. A
guilty bishop had bribed the opposing witnesses, and no testimony
was obtainable for his conviction. Hildebrand addressed
him: “The episcopal grace is a gift of the Holy Ghost. If,
therefore, you are innocent, repeat, ‘Glory to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost!’” The bishop boldly
commenced, “Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>”
here his voice failed him, he was unable to finish the sentence;
and, confessing the sin, he was deposed.<a id="FNanchor_1110_1110" href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a></p>

<p>Henry’s prudence in declining the Eucharistic ordeal was
proved by the fate of the unfortunate Imbrico, Bishop of
Augsburg, who, in the same year, 1077, after swearing fealty to
Rodolph of Suabia, abandoned him and joined the emperor.
Soon after, while saying mass before Henry, to prove the force
of his loyal convictions, he declared that the sacrament he
was about to take should attest the righteousness of his master’s
cause; and the anti-imperialist chronicler duly records that a
sudden disease overtook him, to be followed by speedy death.<a id="FNanchor_1111_1111" href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a>
In the case of William, Bishop of Utrecht, as related by
Hugh of Flavigny, the Eucharist was less an ordeal than a
punishment. He dared, at the Assembly of Utrecht, in 1076,
to excommunicate Gregory, at the command of Henry IV.;
but when, at the conclusion of the impious ceremony, he
audaciously took the Host, it turned to fire within him, and,
shrieking “I burn! I burn!” he fell down and miserably died.<a id="FNanchor_1112_1112" href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a></p>

<p>According to a Spanish theologian in the sixteenth century,
when the Eucharist was administered as an ordeal it was to be
taken without previous sacramental confession—presumably in
order that the accused might not escape in consequence of
absolution.<a id="FNanchor_1113_1113" href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> After the Reformation, the Protestants who denied
the real presence naturally rejected this form of ordeal,
but Del Rio, writing in 1599, compares them to frogs swelling
themselves against an elephant; and Peter Kluntz, in 1677,
assures us that it was still commonly used in his day.<a id="FNanchor_1114_1114" href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a></p>

<small>THE ORDEAL OF THE LOT.</small></h3>


<p>The appeal to chance, as practised in India, bears several
forms, substantially identical in principle. One mode consists
in writing the words <i>dherem</i> (consciousness of innocence) and
<i>adherem</i> (its opposite) on plates of silver and lead respectively,
or on pieces of white and black linen, which are placed in a
vessel that has never held water. The person whose cause is
at stake inserts his hand and draws forth one of the pieces,
when if it happens to be <i>dherem</i> it proves his truth.<a id="FNanchor_1115_1115" href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> Another
method is to place in a vessel a silver image of Dharma, the
genius of justice, and one in iron or clay of Adharma; or else
a figure of Dharma is painted on white cloth and another on
black cloth, and the two are rolled together in cow-dung and
thrown into a jar, when the accused is acquitted or convicted
according to his fortune in drawing Dharma.<a id="FNanchor_1116_1116" href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a></p>

<p>In adapting to Christian usage the ordeal of the lot, attempts
were made to invest it with similar sacred symbolism,
but it was not well adapted to display the awful solemnity
which rendered the other forms so impressive. Notwithstanding
the ample warrant for it in Scripture, and its approval by
St. Augustin,<a id="FNanchor_1117_1117" href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> it was therefore in less favor with the Church,
and it seems not to have retained among the people, after
their conversion, the widespread popularity and confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
enjoyed by the other ordeals. Indeed, as a judicial process,
it is only to be found prescribed in the earlier remains of the
Barbarian laws and customs, and no trace of it is to be met
with in the latter legislation of any race. Thus mention of it
is made in the Ripuarian code,<a id="FNanchor_1118_1118" href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> and in some of the earlier
Merovingian documents its use is prescribed in the same brief
manner.<a id="FNanchor_1119_1119" href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a> As late as the middle of the eighth century,
Ecgberht, Archbishop of York, quotes from the canons of an
Irish Council a direction for its employment in cases of sacrilegious
theft, as a means of determining the punishment to be
inflicted;<a id="FNanchor_1120_1120" href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a> but not long after, the Council of Calchuth condemned
the practice between litigants as a sacrilege and a
remnant of paganism.<a id="FNanchor_1121_1121" href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> This was ineffectual, for about 850
Leo IV. describes it as in universal use in England, and forbids
it as mere divination.<a id="FNanchor_1122_1122" href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a></p>

<p>No explanation is given of the details of the process by
which this appeal to fortune was made, and I know of no
contemporary applications by which its formula can be investigated;
but in the primitive Frisian laws there is described
an ordeal of the lot, which may reasonably be assumed to
show us one of the methods in use. When a man was killed
in a chance-medley and the murderer remained unknown, the
friends had a right to accuse seven of the participants in the
brawl. Each of these defendants had then to take the oath
of denial with twelve conjurators, after which they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
admitted to the ordeal. Two pieces of twig, precisely similar,
were taken, one of which was marked with a cross; they
were then wrapped up separately in white wool and laid on
the altar; prayers were recited, invoking God to reveal the
innocence or guilt of the party, and the priest, or a sinless
youth, took up one of the bundles. If it contained the
marked fragment, the defendants were absolved; if the unmarked
one, the guilty man was among them. Each one
then took a similar piece of stick and made a private mark
upon it; these were rolled up as before, placed on the altar,
taken up one by one, and unwrapped, each man claiming his
own. The one whose piece was left to the last was pronounced
guilty, and was obliged to pay the wer-gild of the murder.<a id="FNanchor_1123_1123" href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a>
Among the ancient Irish the lot or <i>crannchur</i> was employed
by mingling white and black stones, when if the accused drew
a black one he was adjudged guilty.<a id="FNanchor_1124_1124" href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a></p>

<p>The various modes of ecclesiastical divination, so frequently
used in the Middle Ages to obtain an insight into the future,
sometimes assumed the shape of an appeal to Heaven to
decide questions of the present or of the past.<a id="FNanchor_1125_1125" href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> Thus, when
three bishops, of Poitiers, Arras, and Autun, each claimed
the holy relics of St. Liguaire, and human means were una<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>vailing
to reconcile their pretensions, the decision of the
Supreme Power was resorted to, by placing under the altar-cloth
three slips with their respective names inscribed, and
after a becoming amount of prayer, on withdrawing one of
them, the see of Poitiers was enriched with the precious remains
by Divine favor.<a id="FNanchor_1126_1126" href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a></p>

<p>That such appeals to chance were regarded by the Church
with disfavor is shown by Gratian, who argues that the Hebrew
examples were not precedents to be observed under the New
Law.<a id="FNanchor_1127_1127" href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> Yet the second council of Barcelona in 599 had decreed
that when an episcopal vacancy was to be filled two or three
candidates should be chosen by the clergy and people, and
from among these the metropolitan and his suffragans should
select one by lot, after due fasting and prayer.<a id="FNanchor_1128_1128" href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting applications of the lot on record
was that by which the founders of the Bohemian Brethren
determined upon the future existence of the sect. At an
assembly of deputies held at Lhotka, in 1467, the lot was resorted
to to ascertain whether it was the will of God that they
should separate themselves from the Roman presbyterate and
seek consecration from the Waldenses, when the response was
in the affirmative. Then nine men were chosen, from among
whom three or two, or one, or none should be drawn as candidates
for the episcopate. Twelve cards were taken, three
inscribed “is” and nine “is not,” and nine of them were
distributed among the men selected. Three were found to
be drawn; one of them was sent to an Austrian community
of Waldenses for episcopal consecration, and the “Unitas
Fratrum” was then organized.<a id="FNanchor_1129_1129" href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> This same pious dependence
on the will of God is still preserved by the Mennonites in the
choice of pastors. As described in the journals of 1884 an
election of this kind in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
where there were twenty candidates, was conducted by three
bishops. After divine service twenty books with clasps were
taken in one of which was inserted a slip of paper inscribed
<i>Ein Diener des Wort</i>; the books were placed in a row on a
table and each applicant selected one. Bishop Shenk proceeded
to open the books, and in the eleventh, held by Menno
Zimmerman, the paper was found, entitling him to the position.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Closely related to the lot are the appeals to chance, to settle
doubtful questions or ascertain guilt. Such was that made
by the pious monks of Abingdon, about the middle of the
tenth century, to determine their right to the meadows of Beri
against the claims of some inhabitants of Oxfordshire. For
three days, with fasting and prayer, they implored the Divine
Omnipotence to make manifest their right; and then, by
mutual assent, they floated on the Thames a round buckler,
bearing a handful of wheat, in which was stuck a lighted taper.
The sturdy Oxonians gaped at the spectacle from the distant
bank, while a deputation of the more prudent monks followed
close upon the floating beacon. Down the river it sailed,
veering from bank to bank, and pointing out, as with a finger,
the various possessions of the Abbey, till at last, on reaching
the disputed lands, it miraculously left the current of the
stream, and forced itself into a narrow and shallow channel,
which in high water made an arm of the river around the
meadows in question. At this unanswerable decision, the
people with one accord shouted “Jus Abbendoniæ, jus Abbendoniæ!”
and so powerful was the impression produced,
that the worthy chronicler assures us that thenceforth neither
king, nor duke, nor prince dared to lay claim to the lands of
Beri, showing conclusively the wisdom of the abbot who preferred
thus to rely upon his right rather than on mouldy charters
or dilatory pleadings.<a id="FNanchor_1130_1130" href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a></p>

<p>A more prosaic form of the ordeal of chance is the trial by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Bible and key which is of old Teutonic origin.<a id="FNanchor_1131_1131" href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> It is still in
common use in England, where it may even yet “be met with
in many an out-of-the-way-farm-house.” In cases of theft a
key is secured at Psalm 50, 18: “When thou sawest a thief,
then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with
adulterers;”<a id="FNanchor_1132_1132" href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> and the mode in which it is expected to reveal
guilt is manifested in a case recorded in the London <i>Times</i> as
occurring at Southampton in 1867, where a sailor boy on
board a collier was brought before court on a charge of theft,
the only evidence against him being that afforded by securing
a key in a Bible opposite the first chapter of Ruth. The Bible
was then swung round while the names of several suspected
persons were repeated, and on the mention of the prisoner’s
name the book fell on the floor. A somewhat different method
is recounted in a case reported by the journals in 1879, where
a woman in Ludlow, who had lost a sheet, perambulated the
streets of the town with a Bible and key, and brought a prosecution
against a person whose guilt she had thus discovered.
It was explained in court that the key was placed at Ruth <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>
16, the investigator holding his fingers crossed, and when the
thief was named the key would spontaneously move. In this
case the prosecutrix declared that when she came to the defendant’s
house “the Bible turned completely round and
fell out of her hands.” A variant of this, described in two
MSS. of the twelfth century, consisted in placing a piece of
wood over the verse of the Psalm, “Thou art just, O Lord,
and thy judgment is true;” the book was then securely bound
so that the head of the wood protruded, and it was suspended,
while a priest uttered an adjuration and the accused was questioned,
the result being apparently determined by the motion
or rest of the book. Still another form consisted of suspending
a small loaf of bread which had been placed behind the
altar during mass and at its conclusion blessed and marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
with a cross by the priest. At the trial he uttered a conjuration,
when if the bread turned the accused was held guilty.<a id="FNanchor_1133_1133" href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a></p>

<p>Closely akin to the Bible and key is the sieve-driving or
sieve-turning by which criminals were detected by the tilting
or falling of a sieve when, in repeating the names of those suspected,
that of the culprit was mentioned. The sieve required
to be an heirloom in the family; it was balanced on the point
of a pair of scissors, or was laid upon a pair of tongs, or the
point of a pair of scissors was driven into the rim and it was
suspended by the ring to the middle finger of the right hand.
This was of ancient origin and was extensively practised in
France and Germany even in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.<a id="FNanchor_1134_1134" href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> The existence of the same belief in England is
shown in 1554, when William Haselwood, on being cited before
the ecclesiastical court of the diocese of London, said that
having lost his purse “remembering that he being a chylde dyd
hear his mother declare that when any man had lost anything,
then they wolde use a syve and a payre of sheers to bring to
knowledge who hadd the thing lost; and so he did take a
seve and a payre of sheeres and hanged the seve by the pointe
of the sheeres and sayd these words: By Peter and Paule he
hath yt, namying the party whom he in that behalf suspected.”<a id="FNanchor_1135_1135" href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a>
Evidently at this time the Church regarded the process as
sorcery.</p>

<small>BIER-RIGHT.</small></h3>


<p>The belief that at the approach of the murderer the corpse
of the slain would bleed or give some other sign has, under
the names of <i>jus feretri</i>, <i>jus cruentationis</i>, <i>bahr-recht</i>, and
“bier-right,” been a resource eagerly seized by puzzled
jurists. Its source is not easily traced. There is no evidence
of its existence among the Eastern Aryans, nor is it
alluded to in any of the primitive “Leges Barbarorum,”
though Russian legends render probable that it was current
among the Slavs at an early day.<a id="FNanchor_1136_1136" href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> Enthusiastic explorers
into antiquity quote Aristotle for it,<a id="FNanchor_1137_1137" href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a> while others find in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Lucretius evidence that it was shared by cultured Romans.<a id="FNanchor_1138_1138" href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a>
Possibly its origin may be derived from a Jewish custom
under which pardon was asked of a corpse for any offences
committed against the living man, the offender laying hold of
the great toe of the body as prepared for sepulture, and it is
said to be not uncommon, where the injury has been grievous,
for the latter to respond to the touch by a copious nasal hemorrhage.<a id="FNanchor_1139_1139" href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a></p>

<p>The earliest allusion I have met with to this belief occurs
in 1189, and shows that already it was rooted in popular credulity.
It is the well-known story that when Richard Cœur
de Lion hastened to the funeral of his father, Henry II., and
met the procession at Fontevraud, the blood poured from the
nostrils of the dead king, whose end he had hastened by his
rebellion and disobedience.<a id="FNanchor_1140_1140" href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> Although it never seems to have
formed part of English jurisprudence, its vitality in the popular
mind is shown in Shakespeare’s Richard III., where Gloster
interrupts the obsequies of Henry VI. and Lady Anne
exclaims:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O gentlemen,see, see! dead Henry’s wounds</div>
<div class="verse">Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>
<p>And in the ballad of “Earl Richard”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Put na the wite on me, she said,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">It was my may Catherine.</div>
<div class="verse">Then they hae cut baith fern and thorn,</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">And soon the ground was red.”<a id="FNanchor_1141_1141" href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This indicates that the belief was equally prevalent in Scotland.
Indeed King James VI. gave it the stamp of his royal
authority,<a id="FNanchor_1142_1142" href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> and cases on record there show that it was occasionally
received as judicial evidence, and even sometimes
prescribed as an ordeal for detection. Thus in 1611, doubts
arising as to the mode by which a person had met his death,
the vicinage was summoned, as we are told according to custom,
to touch the body which had been exhumed for the purpose.
The murderer, whose rank relieved him of suspicion,
kept away, but his little daughter, attracted by curiosity, approached
the corpse, when it began to bleed and the crime
was proved.<a id="FNanchor_1143_1143" href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> One of the most noted cases in which crime
was detected in this manner was that of Philip Standsfield,
tried in 1688 for the murder of his father, Sir James Standsfield
of New Milne. In this the indictment sets forth that
after the body had been found in a pond and an autopsy had
been performed by a surgeon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> “James Row, merchant, having
lifted the left side of Sir James, his head and shoulder, and
the said Philip the right side, his father’s body, though carefully
cleaned, as said is, did (according to God’s usual mode
of discovering murders), blood afresh upon him and defiled
all his hands, which struck him with such a terror that he
immediately let his father’s head and body fall with violence
and fled from the body and in consternation and confusion
cryed Lord have mercy upon me! and bowed himself down
over a seat in the church (where the corp were inspected),
wiping his father’s innocent blood off his own murdering
hands upon his cloaths.” When such was the spirit of the
prosecution it need not surprise us that though the defence
showed that in the autopsy an incision had been made in the
neck, where there was a large accumulation of extravasated
blood, and though high authorities were quoted to prove that
such bleeding was not evidence sufficient even to justify torture,
Philip Standsfield was condemned and executed in spite
of the insufficiency of circumstantial evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1144_1144" href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> A similar
incident is recorded in the indictment of Christian Wilson,
tried for witchcraft at Edinburgh in 1661.<a id="FNanchor_1145_1145" href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a> These cases are
typical, inasmuch as they illustrate the two forms, the existence
of which differentiates this from other ordeals. Sometimes,
as in others, suspects were brought, under judicial order,
to view or touch the body. Frequently, however, the occurrence
is spontaneous, and serves to excite or direct suspicion
where none existed before.</p>

<p>The belief extended throughout all the nationalities of
Europe. Although there is no reference to it in the German
municipal codes of the thirteenth century, there is ample store
of cases both of its spontaneous occurrence and of its judicial
employment. In 1261, at Forchheim, a manifestation of this
kind brought home to the Jews the lingering death of a young
girl slain by them according to their hellish custom, and the
guilty were promptly broken on the wheel.<a id="FNanchor_1146_1146" href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> More serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
was an affair at Ueberlingen in 1331. The body of a child
was found in a pond and from the character of the wounds it
was recognized that Jewish fanaticism had caused the murder.
The corpse was therefore carried in front of the houses of the
principal Jews and when it began to bleed the evidence was
deemed sufficient. The burgomaster endeavored to calm the
populace, but his efforts were ascribed to Hebrew gold, and
condign punishment was resolved upon. All the Jews of the
town were skilfully decoyed into a large stone house and when
they had been securely locked in the upper stories it was set
on fire. Those that succeeded in throwing themselves from
the roof were dispatched by the mob, and the rest, to the
number of three hundred, were consumed by the avenging
flames. Though sundry miracles ratified the justice of the act,
yet the godless Emperor, Louis of Bavaria, punished the pious
townsfolk by dismantling their walls and levying a heavy fine
upon them.<a id="FNanchor_1147_1147" href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> The judicial employment of the ordeal is seen
in a case in 1324, when Reinward, a canon of Minden, was
murdered by a drunken soldier and the crime was proved by
a trial of this kind.<a id="FNanchor_1148_1148" href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> More satisfactory, as showing how through
the influence of imagination the ordeal sometimes resulted in
substantial justice, was a case in Lucerne in 1503, when Hans
Speiss of Etiswiler murdered his wife. She was duly buried,
but suspicion arose, and after three weeks the body was exhumed
and he was brought before it. As he approached, it
flushed with color and immediately began to bleed. He had
hitherto defiantly asserted his innocence, but at this sight he
fell on his knees, confessed the crime, and begged for mercy.
He was broken on the wheel and died most penitently.<a id="FNanchor_1149_1149" href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a>
Numerous cases are on record of its use throughout Germany
in the seventeenth century, of which it will suffice to refer to
one in which the corpse manifested a discrimination greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
impressing the authorities. It had been dead for thirty-six
hours and refused to bleed on the approach of two persons
suspected. Then three others were brought, one of whom,
George, had planned the murder and been present, but had
not taken personal part in it: for him the corpse bled at the
mouth. Then came Lorenz, who had held the victim when
the blow was struck: for him the mouth frothed and the
wound bled. Finally Claus, who had inflicted the blow,
came, and for him the blood gushed forth from the wound.<a id="FNanchor_1150_1150" href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a></p>

<p>The extent to which popular credulity was prepared to accept
this miraculous manifestation is shown in a story which
obtained wide currency. An Austrian noble journeying to
Vienna passed through a wood in which his dogs scratched
up some bones. Their whiteness struck his fancy; he carried
them to the city and sent them to a cutler to be worked up
into some ornament, when as soon as they were brought into
the presence of the artificer they became covered with blood.
The noble reported the fact to the magistrates, the cutler was
arrested and confessed that twenty years before he had slain
a comrade and buried the body where the bones were found.<a id="FNanchor_1151_1151" href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a>
We may trace a more poetic form of this sympathy in the
legend which relates the welcome given by the bones of
Abelard to Heloise when, twenty years after his death, her
body was consigned to his tomb.</p>

<p>In Denmark, though this form of trial finds no place in the
codes of law, we are told that it was generally used during
the seventeenth century in all appropriate cases.<a id="FNanchor_1152_1152" href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> In Holstein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
there was a custom known as <i>Scheingehen</i>, in which, when a
murderer remained undiscovered, a hand was severed from the
corpse with provident care and preserved as a touchstone for
the future. A celebrated case is related in the books in which
a dead body was found and buried, and the hand was hung
up in the prison of Itzehoe. Ten years later a thief was
arrested and brought there, when the hand immediately began
to bleed freely, and the thief confessed the murder.<a id="FNanchor_1153_1153" href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a></p>

<p>Italy shared fully in the belief. The most distinguished exponent
of the New Learning in the fifteenth century, Marsiglio
Ficino, the Platonist, does not hesitate to adduce it as a fact
well known to judges, in his argument to prove the immortality
of the soul against the Averrhoism fashionable in his day.<a id="FNanchor_1154_1154" href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a>
Equally distinguished as a jurist was Hippolito de’ Marsigli
(died in 1528), who relates that in his youth he was governor
of Alberga, near Genoa, when a murder occurred without
affording evidence as to the perpetrator. By the advice of an
old citizen he had the body brought before him and summoned
all liable to suspicion to pass near it one by one.
When the homicide approached, to the surprise of Marsigli,
the wounds burst out afresh, but his incredulity was such that
he did not consider this to warrant even an arrest until he had
collected sufficient collateral evidence, when the culprit confessed
without torture.<a id="FNanchor_1155_1155" href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> In Venice this ordeal was sometimes
used and likewise in Piedmont, though in the latter region
some magistrates regarded it as fallacious, for their experience
showed that blood had not flowed in the presence of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
subsequently proved to be guilty.<a id="FNanchor_1156_1156" href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> In Corsica the belief, if
not still existent, has been widely diffused until within a few
years.<a id="FNanchor_1157_1157" href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a></p>

<p>France seems to have been even more addicted to this superstition.
About 1580 President Bertrand d’Argentré, in his
Commentaries on the Customs of Brittany, treats it as an indisputable
fact and one affording good evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1158_1158" href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> In Picardy
we are told it was constantly used by magistrates, it was approved
by the courts in Bordeaux, and Chassanée, whose
authority in Burgundy was great, argues that its occurrence
justifies the torture of the accused without further evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1159_1159" href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a>
Spain likewise was not exempt from it. A celebrated case is
cited in the books as occurring in Aragon, where the accused
was brought before the corpse of the victim in the public
square and appealed to God to perform a miracle if he were
guilty, whereupon the body raised its right arm, pointed with
its fingers to the several wounds and then to the accused; this
was regarded as sufficient proof, and under sentence of the
Council of Aragon the culprit was executed. Another case
which occurred at Ledesma, near Salamanca, shows the existence
of the belief in Castile.<a id="FNanchor_1160_1160" href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a></p>

<p>English colonists brought the superstition across the Atlantic,
where it has never been fairly eradicated from the popular
mind. In January, 1680, in Accomac County, Virginia, a
new-born illegitimate child of “Mary, daughter of Sarah,
wife of Paul Carter” died and was buried. It was nearly six
weeks before suspicion was aroused, when the coroner impanelled
a jury of twelve matrons, whose verdict recorded that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Sarah Carter was brought to touch the corpse without result,
but when Paul Carter touched it “immediately whilst he was
stroaking ye childe ye black and settled places above ye body
of ye childe grew fresh and red so that blud was ready to
come through ye skin of ye childe.” On the strength of this
verdict an indictment was found against Paul Carter, but with
what result the records do not show.<a id="FNanchor_1161_1161" href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a> Nearly a century later,
in 1767, the coroner’s jury of Bergen County, N. J., was
summoned to view the body of one Nicholas Tuers, whose
death had led to suspicion of murder. Johannes Demarest,
the coroner, attests that he had no belief in bier-right and paid
no attention to the experiment, when one of the jury touched
the body without result. At length a slave named Harry, who
had been suspected without proof, was brought forward for
the trial when he heard an exclamation “He is the man,”
and was told that the body had bled when touched by Harry.
He then ordered the slave to place his hand on its face, when
about a tablespoonful of blood flowed from each nostril, and
Harry confessed the murder.<a id="FNanchor_1162_1162" href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> So recently as 1833 a man
named Getter was hanged in Pennsylvania for the murder of
his wife, and among the evidence which was allowed to go to
the jury on the trial was that of a female witness, who swore
“If my throat was to be cut I could tell, before God Almighty,
that the deceased smiled when he (the murderer) touched her.
I swore this before the justice, and also that she bled considerably.
I was sent for to dress her and lay her out. He touched
her twice. He made no hesitation about doing it. I also
swore before the justice that it was observed by other people
in the house.”<a id="FNanchor_1163_1163" href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> This is perhaps the latest instance in which
bier-right has figured in regular judicial proceedings, but the
popular belief in it is by no means eradicated. In 1860 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Philadelphia journals mention a case in which the relatives of
a deceased person, suspecting foul play, vainly importuned the
coroner, six weeks after the interment, to have the body exhumed
in order that it might be touched by a person whom
they regarded as concerned in his death. In 1868 at Verdiersville,
Virginia, a suspected murderer was compelled to touch
the body of a woman found murdered in a wood; and in
1869, at Lebanon, Illinois, the bodies of two murdered persons
were exhumed and two hundred of the neighbors were
marched past and made to touch them in the hope of identifying
the criminals.<a id="FNanchor_1164_1164" href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a></p>

<p>In Germany, in the seventeenth century, there was a recognized
formula for the administration of the ordeal. The
corpse was exposed to the open air for some hours, with
breast and stomach bare to insure the thorough coagulation of
the blood. The person suspected was then brought forward
and required to repeat certain adjurations read to him, and
then he was made to touch with two fingers the mouth, the
navel, and the wounds, if there were any. If the corpse
manifested any signs of sensation, if there was frothing at the
mouth, or bleeding from any orifices or wounds it was considered
an evidence of guilt.<a id="FNanchor_1165_1165" href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> The trial was not a mere
popular experiment, but was a judicial proceeding, under the
order of a magistrate.</p>

<p>Although bier-right, in comparison with other ordeals, plays
so inconspicuous a part in the history of jurisprudence, it is
especially interesting in one respect. As a judicial expedient,
it did not spring into notice until after the other vulgar ordeals
had been discredited and banished from the courts. It escaped
the censure of the Church and was a survival of the
Judgment of God, reaching its fullest development in the seventeenth
century. It thus became the subject of investigation
and debate in an age of critical tendencies and comparative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
intelligence. Among those who had faith in it there was
much fruitless speculation to account for the result, and there
was by no means a consensus of opinion as to the causes at
work. In 1487 the inquisitor Sprenger takes a materialistic
view and uses it as the basis of an argument on the wonderful
properties of inanimate matter. He explains that air is introduced
into the wound when it is inflicted, and that it rushes
out when agitated by the presence of the slayer, bringing
blood with it, but he adds that others believe it to be the cry
of blood from the earth against the murderer, as related of the
first homicide, Cain.<a id="FNanchor_1166_1166" href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> About a century later Del Rio tells us
that some looked upon it as a miracle, others as an accident,
while he himself can see no better reason than the violent
antipathy conceived by the slain for the slayer.<a id="FNanchor_1167_1167" href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> Carena
holds it to be the mysterious Judgment of God, unless it
happens to be the work of the demon, and in this uncertainty
concludes that if there are no other proofs it only justifies
further investigation and not torture.<a id="FNanchor_1168_1168" href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a> Oelsner informs us
that learned men disputed whether it was occasioned by antipathy
or sympathy, by the remains of the soul in the body, by
wandering spirits of the dead, or by the spirit of enmity, and
he concludes that the causes are sometimes natural and sometimes
supernatural.<a id="FNanchor_1169_1169" href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> It is significant that, among so many
theories framed by believers in the fact, there were so few who
assented to the direct interposition of God.</p>

<p>Among jurists there was lively debate as to the exact weight
of the evidence when the experiment was successful. Criminal
lawyers were naturally loath to admit that it was decisive, for
the corollary followed that if no bleeding occurred the suspect
must be innocent, which was contradicted by the numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
cases in which an accused successfully passed through the
ordeal and was subsequently proved to be guilty. This decisiveness
was the essence of the older ordeals, and was wholly
opposed to the current inquisitorial system in which certainty
was aimed at by the habitual use of torture. Almost with
unanimity, therefore, the legists held that it was only one of
the indications pointing to guilt, and that its failure could not
be alleged as a proof of innocence. They differed, however,
as to the weight of the indication which it afforded. Authoritative
names were cited in favor of the opinion that it sufficed
by itself to justify the subjection of the accused to torture, as
in a case at Marburg in 1608, where on this ground alone
several suspects were tortured, when they confessed and were
executed. Others took the position that it did not of itself
warrant the use of torture, and that it required to be supported
by other proof. Among these was the great criminal jurist
Carpzov, who states that in cases submitted to him and his
colleagues he had seen many in which no bleeding occurred
when the murderers touched the corpse, while in others it did
occur when innocents were exposed to the trial.<a id="FNanchor_1170_1170" href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> When the
discussion had reached this stage the ordeal became a superfluity
which was bound to disappear from the courts in spite
of the persistence of popular credulity, and a school of jurists
arose who denied that it deserved the name of evidence, and
declared that it must be wholly disregarded. It was only a
question of time when this opinion should triumph, and the
first quarter of the eighteenth century probably witnessed the
disappearance of this survival of mediævalism from recognized
judicial procedure.<a id="FNanchor_1171_1171" href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a></p>

<small>OATHS AS ORDEALS.</small></h3>


<p>The oath naturally formed an integral portion of the ordeal.
Even as in the battle trial both parties, on entering the lists,
were compelled to swear to the truth of their assertions, so in
the other ordeals the accuser and accused took an oath immediately
prior to the administration of the test.<a id="FNanchor_1172_1172" href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> Sometimes,
however, the oath of the accused was regarded as a sufficient
ordeal in itself. We have seen above how, among many and
diverse races, disculpatory oaths are administered with ceremonies
which render them practically ordeals in view of the
popular belief that misfortune will follow perjury. The anthropomorphic
mythology of Hellas presents this idea in its
most concrete form by the most solemn oath of the gods,
taken on the water of Styx brought in a vase for the purpose,
perjury on which was followed by a year of stupor and nine
years of segregation from all fellowship with the brother immortals.<a id="FNanchor_1173_1173" href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a>
We have also seen (pp. 29 sqq.) that in Christendom
the Church set little store by simple oaths, but reckoned their
obligation by the holiness of the material objects on which
they were taken; and when these were relics of peculiar sanctity
they were held to have the power of punishing the perjurer,
thus rendering the oath administered upon them an
absolute ordeal. This belief developed itself at an early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
period in the history of the Church. St. Augustin relates
that at Milan a thief, who swore upon some holy relics with
the intention of bearing false witness, was forced irresistibly
to confess himself guilty of the offence which he designed to
fasten upon another; and Augustin himself, when unable to
decide between two of his ecclesiastics who accused each
other of revolting crime, sent them both to the shrine of St.
Felix of Nola, in the full expectation that the judgment of
God would bring to light the truth as between them.<a id="FNanchor_1174_1174" href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a>
Gregory the Great shows the same belief when he alludes
to a simple purgatorial oath taken by a bishop on the relics
of St. Peter in terms which expressly convey the idea that
the accused, if guilty, had exposed himself to no little danger,
and that his performance of the ceremony unharmed had sufficiently
proved his innocence. Gregory, moreover, in one
of his Homilies, assumes that perjury committed on the relics
of the saints is punished by demoniacal possession.<a id="FNanchor_1175_1175" href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a></p>

<p>This was not a belief likely to be allowed to die out for lack
of nourishment. When, in the tenth century, Adaulfus, Bishop
of Compostella, was accused of a nameless crime, and was sentenced
by the hasty judgment of the king to be gored to death
by a wild bull, he had taken the precaution, before appearing
at the trial, to devoutly celebrate mass in his full pontificals.
The bull, maddened with dogs and trumpets, rushed furiously
at the holy man; then, suddenly pausing, advanced gently
towards him and placed its horns in his hands, nor could any
efforts of the assistants provoke it to attack him. The king
and his courtiers, awed by this divine interposition in favor
of innocence, threw themselves at the feet of the saint, who
pardoned them and retired to the wildest region of the Astu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>rias,
where he passed the rest of his days as an anchorite.
He left his chasuble behind him, however, and this garment
thenceforth possessed the miraculous power that, when worn
by any one taking an oath, it could not be removed if he
committed perjury.<a id="FNanchor_1176_1176" href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a></p>

<p>In other cases the shrines of saints convicted the perjurer by
throwing him down in an epileptic fit, or by fixing him rigid
and motionless at the moment of his invoking them to witness
his false oath.<a id="FNanchor_1177_1177" href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> The monks of Abingdon boasted a black cross
made from the nails of the crucifixion, said to have been given
them by the Emperor Constantine, a false oath on which was
sure to cost the malefactor his life; and the worthy chronicler
assures us that the instances in which its miraculous power had
been triumphantly exhibited were too numerous to be specified.<a id="FNanchor_1178_1178" href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a>
At the priory of Die, dependent on the great Benedictine abbey
of Fleury, there was preserved an arm-bone of St. Maur, which
was possessed of somewhat similar properties. On one occasion
a steward of the priory named Joscelin was accused of
embezzlement, and offered to rebut the evidence against him
by an oath taken on the arm of St. Maur. Rejoiced at passing
through the test triumphantly, he removed his hand from
the relic, and stroking his long beard with it he exclaimed,
“By this beard, the oath I swore was true!” when suddenly
the beard came off in his hand, and his chin, thenceforth hairless,
was the evidence alike of his guilt and his perjury, so that
he and his descendants were at once proclaimed ineligible to
the stewardship.<a id="FNanchor_1179_1179" href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> Less serious in its consequences was a false
oath taken by a peasant on the altar of St. Martial of Limoges.
The offender was deprived of speech, and could only bellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
like an ox until he had prayed over the tomb of the saint, and
his throat had received the sign of the cross from a priest.<a id="FNanchor_1180_1180" href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a>
Even at the present day the jaw-bone of St. Patrick is preserved
near Belfast, and is used extra-judicially as an ordeal,
in the full conviction that the slightest variation from the truth
will bring instantaneous punishment on the perjurer,<a id="FNanchor_1181_1181" href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a> and in
Sardinia a similar oath on relics is believed when false to flay
the hand of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1182_1182" href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> In the Middle Ages these dangerous
relics were common, and however we may smile at the simplicity
of the faith reposed in them, we may rest assured that
on many occasions they were the means of eliciting confessions
which could have been obtained by no devices of legal subtlety
according to modern procedures.</p>

<p>Nor did it always require death to confer the sanctity requisite
to perform these miracles, as was attested during the life
of St. Bertrand of Comminges. A woman accused of adultery
went to the saint and laying her hand on him swore to her innocence,
when the hand immediately withered and remained
a permanent witness of her guilt and her perjury.<a id="FNanchor_1183_1183" href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a></p>

<p>Even without any special sanctity in the administration of
the oath, Heaven sometimes interposed to protect the rights of
the Church. About the year 1200 Cæsarius of Königswinter,
a knight, who had borrowed twenty marcs of his brother,
Hirminold Dean of the Chapter of Bonn, denied the loan
after his brother’s death. As the money belonged to the
Church, the chapter summoned the knight, and having no
proof, were obliged to content themselves with his oath.
Having accomplished his perjury, Cæsarius mounted his
horse and returned homewards, but when he had accom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>plished
the half of his journey his horse was suddenly fixed
immovable to the earth, and he found himself deprived of
the use of the tongue which he had thus abused. Recognizing
the source of the trouble, he prayed to Abraham,
promising to retrace his steps and confess his sin. He was
immediately released, returned to Bonn, made restitution,
and accepted penance. He subsequently entered the monastery
of Heisterbach as a novice, and related the story of himself.<a id="FNanchor_1184_1184" href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a></p>

<small>POISON ORDEALS.</small></h3>


<p>The poison ordeal, which forms the basis of judicial proceedings
among so many of the African tribes, seems not to
have been brought into Europe by the Aryan invaders, although
it was in use among their kindred who remained in the East.
Possibly this may have arisen from the fact that in their migrations
they could no longer obtain the substances which they
had been accustomed to use, and before they had familiarized
themselves with the resources of their new homes the custom
may have fallen into desuetude amid the abundance of other
methods. A lingering remnant of it may perhaps be detected
in the trial of the priestess of the Gæum in Achaia, already
alluded to, but substantially the poison ordeal may be regarded
as obsolete in the West.</p>

<p>In the East, however, it has continued in use. The poison
prescribed is that known as <i>sringa</i>, produced by a tree which
grows in the Himalayas, and the judge invokes it—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On account of thy venomous and dangerous nature thou
art destruction to all living creatures; thou, O poison, knowest
what mortals do not comprehend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>
<p>“This man being arraigned in a cause desires to be cleared
from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from
this perplexity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Seven grains of the substance, mixed with clarified butter,
are then administered; if no evil symptoms follow during the
day, at evening the accused is dismissed as innocent.<a id="FNanchor_1185_1185" href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> A more
recent authority describes a somewhat different form. A
specified quantity of some deadly article, varying in amount
with its activity, is mixed with thirty times its weight of <i>ghee</i>,
or clarified butter. The patient takes this, standing with his
face to the north, and if it produces no effect upon him while
the bystanders can clap their hands five hundred times, he is
pronounced innocent and antidotes are at once administered
to him.<a id="FNanchor_1186_1186" href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> A slight variation of this is recorded by a writer of
the last century. After appropriate religious ceremonies, seven
barleycorns of the deadly root <i>vishanaga</i>, or of arsenic, are
mingled with thirty-two times its bulk of <i>ghee</i>, and eaten by
the accused from the hand of a Brahman. If it produces no
effect, he is acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1187_1187" href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> Much more humane was the custom
described by Hiouen Thsang in the seventh century, when the
experiment was performed vicariously on a bullock, even as a
hen is used among the Niam-Niam of equatorial Africa. The
animal was fed with poisoned food, and poison was likewise
inserted in a wound made for the purpose in the right leg,
while the fate of the accused was determined by the death or
survival of the unlucky beast.<a id="FNanchor_1188_1188" href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a></p>

<p>Still another form in modern times seems to have been
invented as a combination of the hot-water and poison ordeals.
A <i>naga</i> or cobra is dropped into a deep earthen pot along with
a coin or ring, which the person on trial must remove with his
hand. If he is bitten, he is condemned; if he escapes scathless,
he is acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1189_1189" href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a></p>

<small>IRREGULAR ORDEALS.</small></h3>


<p>The devout dependence upon Heaven, exhibited in the
ordeal, did not exhaust itself on the forms of trial described
above, but was manifested in various other expedients, sometimes
adopted as legal processes, and sometimes merely the
outcome of individual credulous piety. While therefore they
cannot be regarded as forming part of the recognized institutions
of Europe, still they illustrate too clearly the tendency
of thought and belief to be entirely passed over.</p>

<p>Among these may be classed a practice which was substantially
an appeal to God to regulate the amount of punishment
requisite for the expiation of a crime. One or more bands of
iron were not infrequently fastened around the neck or arm of
a murderer, who was banished until by pilgrimage and prayer
his reconciliation and pardon should be manifested by the
miraculous loosening of the fetter, showing that soul and body
were both released from their bonds.<a id="FNanchor_1190_1190" href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> A case is related of a
Pole thus wandering with a circlet tightly clasped to each arm.
One fell before the intercession of St. Adalbert, the apostle of
Prussia, but the other retained its hold until the sinner came
to the shrine of St. Hidulf near Toul. There, joining in the
worship of the holy monks, the remaining band flew off with
such force that it bounded against the opposite wall, while the
pardoned criminal fell fainting to the ground, the blood pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>ing
from his liberated arm: a miracle gratefully recorded by
the spiritual children of the saint.<a id="FNanchor_1191_1191" href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> Equally melodramatic in
its details is a similar instance of an inhabitant of Prunay
near Orléans, laden with three iron bands for fratricide. His
weary pilgrimage was lightened of two by the intercession of
St. Peter at Rome, and the third released itself in the most
demonstrative manner through the merits of St. Bertin and
St. Omer.<a id="FNanchor_1192_1192" href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> If the legend of St. Emeric of Hungary be true,
the pope himself did not disdain to prescribe this ordeal to
the criminal whose miraculous release caused the immediate
canonization of the saint by a synod in 1073.<a id="FNanchor_1193_1193" href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> In France at
one time we are told that this penance or punishment was
habitual in cases of parricide or fratricide, when the rings or
chains were wrought from the sword with which the crime
had been committed.<a id="FNanchor_1194_1194" href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a> Repentant sinners also frequently
bound themselves with iron rings and chains by way of
penance, and the spontaneous disruption of these, which sometimes
occurred, was regarded as a sign that God had pardoned
the penitent.<a id="FNanchor_1195_1195" href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> The shrine of St. Nicetius at Lyons had a
special reputation in these cases, and the pile of broken rings
and chains exhibited there in the sixth century testified to the
power of the saint’s intercession.<a id="FNanchor_1196_1196" href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a></p>

<p>The spirit of the age is likewise manifested in an appeal to
Heaven which terminated a quarrel in the early part of the
twelfth century between St. Gerald, Archbishop of Braga, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
a magnate of his diocese, concerning the patronage of a church.
Neither being inclined to yield, at length the noble prayed that
God would decide the cause by not permitting the one who
was in the wrong to live beyond the year, to which St. Gerald
assented; and in six months the death of the unhappy noble
showed how dangerous it was to undertake such experiments
with a saint.<a id="FNanchor_1197_1197" href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a> This, indeed, may be held to have warrant of
high authority, for when, in 336, Alexander Bishop of Constantinople
was about to engage in disputation with the arch-heretic
Arius, he underwent a long fast, and shut himself up
for many days and nights alone in his church praying to God,
and finally supplicating that if his faith were wrong he might
not live to see the day of contest, while if Arius were in error
he likewise might be taken off in advance; and the orthodoxy
of the Nicene creed was confirmed miraculously by the sudden
and terrible death of Arius within a few days.<a id="FNanchor_1198_1198" href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a></p>

<p>The error of the Arian doctrine of the Trinity was demonstrated
by another volunteer miracle about the year 510, when
Deuterius the Arian Bishop of Constantinople undertook to
baptize a convert in the name of the Father through the Son
in the Holy Ghost, and was rebuked for using this heretical
formula by the sudden disappearance of all the water in the
font.<a id="FNanchor_1199_1199" href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a></p>

<p>With these examples may be classed a trial of faith proposed
by Herigarius, one of the earliest Christian converts of Sweden,
as conclusive, though not so dangerous as that of Bishop
Poppo. After frequent disputes with his Pagan neighbors, he
one day suggested, when a storm was approaching, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
should stand on one side and he on the other, and see which
of them would get wet. The rain came down in torrents and
nearly drowned the heathen scoffers, while Herigarius and a
boy in his company serenely looked on, untouched by a single
drop.<a id="FNanchor_1200_1200" href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a></p>

<p>When, at the end of the ninth century, the attacks of Rollo
and his Normans drove the monks of St. Martin of Tours to
seek safety for themselves and the priceless relics of their saint
at Auxerre, the body of St. Martin was deposited in the
church of St. Germain near the tomb of the latter. The
miracles wrought by the newcomer speedily caused a large
influx of oblations which the strangers took to themselves.
The monks of St. Germain claimed an equal share on the
ground that the miracles were wrought by the combined merits
of both saints. The Touraingeois resisted the demand, and
finally offered to decide the question by taking a leper and
placing him for a night between the rival reliquaries. If he
should in the morning be entirely cured, they agreed to admit
that both saints were concerned in the miracles, and that the
receipts should be shared; but if only one side of him was
restored to health then the saint on whose side he was cured
should have the credit and his monks the money. This was
agreed to; the leper was placed between the tombs, and both
parties spent the night in prayer. In the morning he was
found with the half of him towards St. Martin sound and well,
while the side towards St. Germain had not been in the least
benefited. To remove any lingering doubts, he was then
turned around, and the other side was cured. The result was
beyond further question, and the monks of St. Martin were
permitted to enjoy in peace thenceforth the offerings of the
faithful.<a id="FNanchor_1201_1201" href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a></p>

<p>It occasionally happened that the direct interference of
Heaven, without the use of formulas, was volunteered to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the blundering hand of human justice. In 1219, near Cologne,
a man was condemned for theft and promptly hanged,
but when the spectators supposed him comfortably dead, he
suddenly exclaimed, “Your labor is vain; you cannot strangle
me, for my lord bishop St. Nicholas is aiding me. I see him.”
Taking this for a convincing proof of his innocence, the crowd
at once cut him down, and he hastened to the church of
Bruweiler to give thanks for his miraculous escape.<a id="FNanchor_1202_1202" href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a> It is
curious to observe, however, that the pious contemporary
narrator of this instance of the power of St. Nicholas is careful
to let us understand that the man may have been guilty
after all. St. Olaf of Norway once interfered in the same
way to support, during nine hours of suspension, a man unjustly
hanged on a false accusation of theft.<a id="FNanchor_1203_1203" href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a></p>

<p>Heaven could also be directly appealed to without the intervention
of the hot iron or boiling water. A question of much
importance to northern Italy was thus settled in the tenth
century, when Uberto of Tuscany, driven into exile by Otho
the Great, returned after a long absence, and found his wife
Willa with a likely boy whose paternity he refused to acknowledge.
After much parleying, the delicate question was
thus settled. A large assembly, consisting principally of
ecclesiastics, was convened, in which Uberto sat without anything
to distinguish him. The boy, who had never seen him,
was placed in the centre, and prayers were offered by all
present that he should be led by divine instinct to his father.
The prayers were promptly answered, for he rushed without
hesitation to the arms of Uberto, who could no longer indulge
in unworthy doubts, and in time Ugo became the most powerful
prince of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1204_1204" href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a></p>

<p>There would appear to have been a form of ordeal known
as the judgment of the Holy Ghost, but its details are unknown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Pope Stephen VII. employed it for the condemnation of the
body of his predecessor Pope Formosus, in 896. The corpse
was dug up for the purpose, clad in papal vestments, and
brought before a synod of bishops; after condemnation, the
three fingers used in benediction were cut off, and it was cast
into the Tiber. After the murder of Stephen in 898, John IX.
assembled another council which annulled the condemnation
and forbade such proceedings in the future, for the unanswerable
reason that a dead body cannot vindicate itself, and the
judgment was still further discredited when the corpse was
fished out of the river, and on being brought into St. Peter’s all
the sacred images there bowed to it. Whatever may have been
the judgment of the Holy Ghost it naturally became obsolete.<a id="FNanchor_1205_1205" href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest and at the same time one of the most
barbarous of ordeals is prescribed in a MS. of the eleventh
century for Jews unlucky enough to be involved in controversies
with Christians. The Jew was made to stand up and
his knees were closely bound together; a collar made of
brambles was placed around his neck, and a switch of brambles,
five cubits long and well furnished with thorns, was smartly
dragged between his thighs. If he escaped without a scratch
he was acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1206_1206" href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a></p>

<p>In the crazied effort to detect the all-pervading and secret
crime of witchcraft, a number of superstitious observances
found currency among the people which practically assumed
the position of ordeals. Thus in the latter half of the sixteenth
century it was believed that a fragment of earth from
a grave, when sanctified in the Mass and placed on the
threshold of a church door, would prevent the egress of any
witch who might be within; and a similar power was attributed
to a splinter of oak from a gallows, sprinkled with
holy water and hung up in the church porch.<a id="FNanchor_1207_1207" href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a></p>

<small>CONDITIONS OF THE ORDEAL.</small></h3>


<p>The ordeal was thoroughly and completely a judicial process,
ordained by the law for certain cases, and carried out
by the tribunals as a regular form of ordinary procedure.
From the earliest times, the accused who was ordered to
undergo the trial was compelled to submit to it, as to any
other decree of court. Thus, by the Salic law, a recusant was
summoned to the royal court; and if still contumacious, he
was outlawed and his property confiscated, as was customary
in all cases of contempt.<a id="FNanchor_1208_1208" href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> The directions of the codes, as we
have seen, are generally precise, and admit of no alternative.<a id="FNanchor_1209_1209" href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a>
Occasionally, however, a privilege of selection was afforded
between this and other modes of compurgation, and also between
the various forms of ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1210_1210" href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a></p>

<p>There was, however, a remarkable exception to this enforcement
of the ordeal in a provision existing in some codes by
which a man condemned to it could buy himself off by compounding
with his adversary. This mode of adjustment was
not extensively introduced, but it nevertheless existed among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the Anglo-Saxons,<a id="FNanchor_1211_1211" href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> while among the Franks it was a settled
custom, permitted by all the texts of the Salic law, from the
earliest to the latest.<a id="FNanchor_1212_1212" href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> By this a person condemned by the
court to undergo the ordeal could, by a transaction with the
aggrieved party, purchase the privilege of clearing himself by
canonical purgation, and thus escape the severer trial. He
was bound to pay his accuser only a portion of the fine which
he would incur if proved guilty—a portion varying with different
offences from one-fourth to one-sixth of the <i>wer-gild</i>.
The interests of the tribunal were guarded by a clause which
compelled him to pay to the <i>grafio</i>, or judge, the full <i>fredum</i>,
or public fine, if his conscience impelled him to submit to an
arrangement for more than the legal percentage. Even as late
as 1229, by the Bohemian laws of Ottokar Premislas the accused
could escape the ordeal by paying seven deniers to the
seigneur.<a id="FNanchor_1213_1213" href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a></p>

<p>The circumstances under which its employment was ordered
varied considerably with the varying legislations of races and
epochs; and to enter minutely into the question of the power
of the court to decree it, or the right to demand it by the appellant
or the defendant, would require too much space,
especially as this has already been discussed at some length
with regard to one of its forms, the wager of battle. In
India, the accused was required to undergo the risk of a fine
if he desired to force his adversary to the ordeal; but either
party could voluntarily undertake it, in which case the other
was subject to a mulct if defeated.<a id="FNanchor_1214_1214" href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> The character of the defendant,
however, had an important bearing upon its employment.
If he had already been convicted of a crime or of
perjury he was subject to it in all cases, however trifling; if,
on the other hand, he was a man of unblemished reputation,
he was not to be exposed to it, however important was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
case.<a id="FNanchor_1215_1215" href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> In civil cases, however, it apparently was only employed
to supplement deficient evidence.—“Evidence consists
of writings, possession, and witnesses. If one of these is
wanting, then one of the ordeals is valid.”<a id="FNanchor_1216_1216" href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></p>

<p>In Europe there appears at times to have been a custom
under which, when the accused had escaped in the ordeal, the
accuser was obliged to undergo it. Thus in the Frisian
law, when a man accused of theft proved his innocence by
the ordeal, the accuser was then obliged to clear himself of
the charge of perjury by a similar trial,<a id="FNanchor_1217_1217" href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> but the law fails to
define what are their respective positions if the second ordeal
proves likewise innocuous. In the case of bier-right quoted
above from Scott’s Border Minstrelsy, this secondary ordeal
seems to have been to prove whether the accuser herself was
not the guilty person. In the heroic poems of the Elder
Edda a similar trial appears to be resorted to, as in the Frisian
laws, only for the purpose of showing the false witness borne
by the accuser. When Gudrun the wife of Atli is defamed
as an adulteress by the concubine Herkia, and is forced to the
ordeal—</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>
<p>Churchmen held that if the accused escaped in the ordeal
the accuser was guilty of perjury and homicide and must atone
for it by public penitence.<a id="FNanchor_1219_1219" href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a></p>

<p>The absence of satisfactory testimony, rendering the case
one not to be solved by human means alone is frequently,
as in India, alluded to as a necessary element;<a id="FNanchor_1220_1220" href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> and indeed we
may almost assert that this was so, even when not specifically
mentioned, as far as regards the discretion of the tribunal to
order an appeal to the judgment of God. Yet there were
some exceptions to this, as in the early Russian legislation,
where the ordeal is prescribed for the accused in all cases in
which the accusation is substantiated by testimony;<a id="FNanchor_1221_1221" href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> and a law
of King Ethelred seems to indicate that the plaintiff might require
his adversary to submit to it,<a id="FNanchor_1222_1222" href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> while numerous examples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
among those cited above authorize the conclusion that an offer
on the part of the accused was rarely refused, even when there
was strong evidence against him,<a id="FNanchor_1223_1223" href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> though this laxity of practice
was occasionally objected to stoutly.<a id="FNanchor_1224_1224" href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> When the custom
was declining, indeed, a disposition existed to require the assent
of both parties before the tribunal would allow a case to
be thus decided.<a id="FNanchor_1225_1225" href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> In civil cases, we may assume that absence
of testimony, or the consent of both parties, was requisite to its
employment.<a id="FNanchor_1226_1226" href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p>The comfort which the system must have afforded to indolent
judges in doubtful cases is well exhibited by a rule in
various ancient codes, by which a man suspected of crime,
even though no accuser came forward, was thrown into
prison and kept there until he could prove his innocence by
the ordeal of water.<a id="FNanchor_1227_1227" href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> No testimony was required save that
of evil repute. Thus in Hungary, in the eleventh century, a
man who was regarded as a thief by the whole village was
subjected to the ordeal: if he was cleared, he paid the fee to
the priest; if he was convicted, all his property was confiscated.<a id="FNanchor_1228_1228" href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a>
This, in fact, was virtually the process adopted and
systematized in England by the Assizes of Clarendon in 1166.
The grand jury was directed to present all persons suspected
of robbery, murder, theft, etc., when they were promptly sent
to the water ordeal to prove their innocence.<a id="FNanchor_1229_1229" href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> Thus it afforded
an unfailing solution to all doubts and simplified
greatly the administration of criminal law, for it was equally
applicable to cases of individual prosecutions. In 1201, for
instance, a widow accuses a man of the murder of her husband
and the court rejects her appeal because it does not state
that she saw the deed, but as the jurors when interrogated say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
that the accused is suspected of the crime, he is ordered at
once to the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1230_1230" href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a></p>

<p>We have seen above occasional instances in which the
accuser or plaintiff offered to substantiate his veracity by
an appeal to the ordeal. This was an established rule with
regard to the wager of battle, but not as respects the other
forms of the judgment of God, which were regarded rather as
means of defence than of attack. Still there are occasional
instances of instructions for their employment by the accusing
party. In the primitive laws of Russia, an accuser who could
not substantiate his case with witnesses was obliged to undergo
the ordeal of red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_1231_1231" href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> In England it seems to have been
within the discretion of the court to order it for either the
accuser or the accused. A very singular case is recorded in
1202, in which Astin of Wispington accused Simon of Edlington
of assaulting him and putting out an eye, when the
court adjudged the red-hot iron ordeal and gave to the defendant
the option whether he or the prosecutor should undergo
it; Simon naturally preferred that his antagonist should try
the dangerous experiment, and the result was that the case
was settled without it.<a id="FNanchor_1232_1232" href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> We have already seen (p. 385) that
in some places where the accused succeeded in clearing himself
by the ordeal the accuser was obliged to undergo it in
order to determine the question of his perjury.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ordeal was employed in connection with
compurgation, both for prosecution and defence, to supplement
the notorious imperfections of that procedure. Thus
Archbishop Hincmar directs that cases of complaint against
priests for dissolute life shall be supported by seven witnesses,
of whom one must submit to the ordeal to prove the truth of
his companions’ oaths, as a wholesome check upon perjury and
subornation.<a id="FNanchor_1233_1233" href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> With a similar object, the same prelate likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
enjoins it on compurgators chosen by the accused, on his failing
to obtain the support of those who had been selected for
him by his judge.<a id="FNanchor_1234_1234" href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> Allied to this was a rule for its employment
which was extensively adopted, allowing the accused the
privilege of compurgation with conjurators in certain cases,
only requiring him to submit to the ordeal on his failing to
procure the requisite number of sponsors. Thus, in 794, a
certain Bishop Peter, who was condemned by the Synod of
Frankfort to clear himself, with two or three conjurators, of
the suspicion of complicity in a conspiracy against Charlemagne,
being unable to obtain them, one of his vassals offered
to pass through the ordeal in his behalf, and on his success
the bishop was reinstated.<a id="FNanchor_1235_1235" href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> That this was strictly in accordance
with usage is shown by a very early text of the Salic
Law,<a id="FNanchor_1236_1236" href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> as well as by a similar provision in the Ripuarian code.<a id="FNanchor_1237_1237" href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a>
Among the Anglo-Saxons it likewise obtained, from the time
of the earliest allusion to the ordeal occurring in their jurisprudence,
down to the period of the Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_1238_1238" href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> Somewhat
similar in tendency was a regulation of Frederic Barbarossa,
by which a slave suspected of theft was exposed to the red-hot
iron unless his master would release him by an oath.<a id="FNanchor_1239_1239" href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a> Occasionally
it was also resorted to when the accused was outsworn
after having endeavored to defend himself by his oath or by
conjurators. Thus a canon of the Council of Tribur in 895<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
declares that if a man is so generally suspected that he is outsworn
in compurgation, he must either confess or submit to
the hot-iron ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1240_1240" href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> Popular belief evidently might give to
the accuser a larger number of men willing to associate themselves
in the oath of accusation than the defendant could find
to join him in rebutting it, and yet his guilt might not as yet
be clear. In such cases, the ordeal was a most convenient resort.</p>

<p>These regulations give to the ordeal decidedly the aspect of
punishment, as it was thus inflicted on those whose guilt was so
generally credited that they could not find comrades to stand
up with them at the altar as partakers in their oath of denial;
and this is not the only circumstance which leads us to believe
that it was frequently so regarded. This notion is visible
in the ancient Indian law, where, as we have seen, certain
of the ordeals—those of red-hot iron, poison, and the balance—could
not be employed unless the matter at stake were
equivalent to the value of a thousand pieces of silver, or involved
an offence against the king;<a id="FNanchor_1241_1241" href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> and it reappears in Europe
in the graduated scale of single and triple ordeals for offences
of different magnitudes. Such a scheme is so totally at variance
with the theory of miraculous interposition to protect
innocence and punish guilt, that we can only look upon it as
a mode of inflicting graduated punishments in doubtful cases,
thus holding up a certain penalty <i>in terrorem</i> over those who
would otherwise hope to escape by the secrecy of their crime—no
doubt with a comforting conviction, like that of Legate
Arnaud at the sack of Béziers, that God would know his
own. This same principle is visible in a provision of the
charter of Loudun, granted by Louis le Gros in 1128, by
which an assault committed outside of the liberties of the
commune could be disproved by a simple sacramental oath;
but if within the limits of the commune, the accused was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
obliged to undergo the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1242_1242" href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> In another shape we see it in
the customs of Tournay, granted by Philip Augustus in 1187,
where a person accused of assault with sharpened weapons, if
there were no witnesses, was allowed to purge himself with six
conjurators if the affair occurred in the daytime, but if at
night, was obliged to undergo the water ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1243_1243" href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> Further
illustration is afforded by the principle, interwoven in various
codes, by which a first crime was defensible by conjurators,
or other means, while the <i>tiht-bysig</i> man, the <i>homo infamatus</i>,
one of evil repute, whose character had been previously compromised,
was denied this privilege, and was forced at once to
the hot iron or the water. Thus, among the Anglo-Saxons,
in the earliest allusion to the ordeal, by Edward the Elder, it
is provided that perjured persons, or those who had once been
convicted, should not be deemed thereafter oath-worthy, but
should be hurried to the ordeal; a regulation repeated with
some variations in the laws of Ethelred, Cnut, and Henry I.<a id="FNanchor_1244_1244" href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a>
The Carlovingian legislation establishes a similar principle,<a id="FNanchor_1245_1245" href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a>
while the canons of Burckhardt show it to be still in force in
the eleventh century.<a id="FNanchor_1246_1246" href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> A hundred and fifty years later, the
legislation of Flanders manifests the same tendency, the code
granted to Bruges in 1190 providing that a first accusation of
theft should be decided by witnesses, while a second was to
be met by the cold-water ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1247_1247" href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> In the German municipal
law of the thirteenth century, the same principle is observable.
A man who had forfeited his legal privileges by conviction for
theft or similar crimes was no longer admitted to the oath, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
on subsequent accusations was compelled to choose between
the hot iron, the cauldron, and a combat with a champion;
and similarly an officer of the mint issuing false money was
permitted the first time to swear to his ignorance, but on a
second offence he had to submit to the ordeal. In the codes
in force throughout Germany, indeed, previous suspicion was
sufficient to send the accused to the ordeal in place of the
oath.<a id="FNanchor_1248_1248" href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> The contemporary jurisprudence of Spain has a somewhat
similar provision, by which a woman accused of homicide
could not be exposed to the ordeal unless she could be proved
utterly abandoned, for which a curious standard was requisite;<a id="FNanchor_1249_1249" href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a>
while for more serious crimes, such as sorcery or killing her
husband, she was forced at once to the red-hot iron to prove
her innocence. In the legislation of Charlemagne there is an
elaborate provision, by which a man convicted seven times of
theft was no longer allowed to escape on payment of a fine,
but was required to undergo the ordeal of fire. If he succumbed,
he was put to death; if he escaped unhurt, he was
not discharged as innocent, but his lord was allowed to enter
bail for his future good behavior<a id="FNanchor_1250_1250" href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a>—a mode at once of administering
punishment and of ascertaining whether his death
would be agreeable to Heaven. When we thus regard it as a
penalty on those who by misconduct had forfeited the confidence
of their fellow-men, the system loses part of its absurdity,
in proportion as it departs from the principle under
which it was established.</p>

<p>There is also another aspect in which it is probable that the
ordeal was viewed by those whose common sense must have
shrunk from it as a simple appeal to the judgment of God.
There can be little doubt that it was frequently found of mate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>rial
use in extorting confession or unwilling testimony. By
the early codes, as in the primitive Greek and Roman law,
torture could be applied only to slaves, and the ordeal was a
legalized torture, applied under circumstances peculiarly provocative
of truth, and as such we occasionally find regulations
which enable the freeman to escape by compurgation, while
the slave is required to undergo the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1251_1251" href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> The elaborate
nature of the ritual employed, with its impressive adjurations
and exorcisms, was well fitted to excite the imagination and
alarm the conscience; sometimes, indeed, to render it more
effective, the mass celebrated was a mortuary one, which when
sung for a living man was popularly believed to possess deadly
powers of peculiar efficacy.<a id="FNanchor_1252_1252" href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> In those ages of faith, the professing
Christian, conscious of guilt, must indeed have been
hardened who could undergo these awful rites, pledging his
salvation on his innocence, and knowing under such circumstances
that the direct intervention of Heaven could alone save
him from having his hand boiled to rags,<a id="FNanchor_1253_1253" href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> after which he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
to meet the full punishment of his crime, and perhaps in addition
lose a member for the perjury committed. With such a
prospect, all motives would conspire to lead him to a prompt
and frank acknowledgment in the early stages of the proceedings
against him. These views are strengthened by the fact
that when, in the thirteenth century, the judicial use of torture,
as a means of obtaining testimony and confession, was
becoming systematized and generally employed, the ordeal
was falling into desuetude and rapidly disappearing. The
latter had fulfilled its mission, and the former was a substitute
better fitted for an age which reasoned more, believed less,
and at the same time was quite as arbitrary and cruel as its
predecessor. A further confirmation of this supposition is
afforded by the coincidence that the only primitive jurisprudence
which excluded the ordeal—that of the Wisigoths—was
likewise the only one which habitually permitted the use
of torture,<a id="FNanchor_1254_1254" href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a> the only reference to the ordeal in their code being
a provision which directs its employment as a preliminary to
the more regular forms of torture.</p>

<p>In fact, the ordeal was practically looked upon as a torture
by those whose enlightenment led them to regard as a superstition
the faith popularly reposed in it. An epistle which is
attributed both to Stephen V. and Sylvester II. condemns the
whole system on the ground that the canons forbid the extortion
of confessions by heated irons and boiling water; and
that a credulous belief could not be allowed to sanction that
which was not permitted by the fathers.<a id="FNanchor_1255_1255" href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> When, therefore, at
the Council of St. Baseul, a priest named Adalger, in confessing
the assistance he had rendered to Arnoul of Reims
during Charles of Lorraine’s resistance to the usurpation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
Hugh Capet, offered to substantiate his testimony by undergoing
the ordeal, he did it in terms which show that he expected
it to be regarded as a torture giving additional weight to evidence—“If
any of you doubt this and deem me unworthy of
belief, let him believe the fire, the boiling water, the glowing
iron. Let these tortures convince those who disbelieve my
words.”<a id="FNanchor_1256_1256" href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a> It is observable that he omits the cold-water as not
being a torture, just as in the ancient Indian law the limitation
referred to above as applicable to the red-hot iron, the poison,
and the balance, did not apply to the cold-water ordeal, or to
that in which was administered the water in which an idol
had been dipped.<a id="FNanchor_1257_1257" href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a></p>

<p>In the same way, some among the European ordeals, such
as that of the Eucharist, of bread and cheese, and bier-right,
do not come within the class of tortures, but they addressed
themselves powerfully to the conscience and imagination of
the accused, whose callous fortitude no doubt often gave way
under the trial. In our own country, and almost within our
own time, the latter ordeal was revived in one instance with
this object, and the result did not disappoint the expectations
of those who undertook it. In the case of People <i>vs.</i> Johnson,
tried in New York in 1824, the suspected murderer was led
from his cell to the hospital where lay the body of the victim,
which he was required to touch. Dissimulation which had
been before unshaken failed him at the awful moment; his
overstrung nerves gave way, and a confession was faltered
forth. The proceeding was sustained by court, and a subsequent
attempt at retraction was overruled.<a id="FNanchor_1258_1258" href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a> The powerful
influence of such feelings is shown in a custom which, as
recently as 1815, was still employed at Mandeure, near Mont-belliard,
and which is said to be even yet in use in some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
the remoter districts of the Ardennes. When a theft has been
committed, the inhabitants are summoned to assemble after
vespers on Sunday at the place of judgment. There the
mayor calls upon the guilty person to make restitution and
live in isolation for six months. If this appeal prove fruitless,
recourse is had to the trial of the staff, in which two magistrates
hold aloft a piece of wood, under which every one is
bound to pass. No instance, it is said, is on record in which
the culprit dares to do this, and he is always left alone.<a id="FNanchor_1259_1259" href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a>
Very similar to this is the use made of the Clog Oir or golden
bell of St. Senan, the founder of the monastery of Inniscattery,
at the mouth of the river Shannon, which was supposed to
have peculiar virtue in revealing culprits. A case occurred as
late as 1834, when a farmer, who had lost a sum of twenty
pounds by a burglary, had the bell brought to his house with
much ceremony, and the following Sunday was appointed for
the whole parish to appear and clear themselves upon it. On
Saturday night, however, the stolen bank notes were thrown
through a window of his house.<a id="FNanchor_1260_1260" href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a> The method described
above (p. 334), as practised in Southern Russia to detect
household thieves, affords another example of the power exercised
over a guilty conscience. It is easy thus to imagine
how the other forms of ordeal may have conduced to the discovery
of crime in ages of lively superstition. A case occurring
about the commencement of the twelfth century is a fair
illustration of the manner in which it frequently worked on
the imagination of those whose lives or fortunes were at stake.
André de Trahent, a vassal of the convent of St. Mary of
Saintes, claimed certain property belonging to the convent.
On the final hearing it was decreed that he must abandon his
claim unless he could prove it by oath and ordeal. This he
agreed to do, and on the appointed day he appeared with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
men ready to undergo the trial. As there were two pieces of
property in question, two ordeals were required. The caldrons
of water were duly heated and André’s men were prepared
for the attempt, when his courage gave way; he
abruptly abandoned his claim and submitted himself to the
mercy of the abbess.<a id="FNanchor_1261_1261" href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a></p>

<p>This case illustrates the fact that in the vulgar ordeals as
well as in the duel champions were sometimes allowed. To
how great an extent this was permitted it would now be difficult
to assert. It is not specially alluded to in any body of laws, but
numerous examples of it have been incidentally given above,
and in some of the <i>ordines</i> it is assumed as a matter of course.
In one for the cold-water ordeal the substitutes are described
as children who are made to fast for forty days in advance, and
carefully watched and washed to prevent any illusions of the
devil.<a id="FNanchor_1262_1262" href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a> In the ordeal of the cross, however, it was a recognized
privilege of the old or infirm to put forward a substitute, and
when communities or churches were pleaders a champion was
of course a necessity. A still greater relaxation, occasionally
permitted but not approved by the Church, was the practice
of writing the name of the accused on paper or some other
substance and submitting this to the ordeal in place of the
individual himself.<a id="FNanchor_1263_1263" href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> Perhaps the most illogical use of a
champion in an ordeal is one suggested by Hincmar of Reims
in 860, that a satisfactory person should undergo it in order
to determine whether the secret motive alleged by another
person for not living with his wife were true or not.<a id="FNanchor_1264_1264" href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a></p>

<small>CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THE ORDEAL.</small></h3>


<p>The degree of confidence really inspired by the results of
the ordeal is a somewhat curious subject of speculation on
which definite opinions are not easily reached. Judicially,
the trial was, for the most part, conclusive; he who had duly
sunk under water, walked unharmed among the burning
shares, or withdrawn an unblistered hand from a caldron of
legal temperature, stood forth among his fellows as innocent.
So, even now, the verdict of a few fools or knaves in a jury-box
may discharge a criminal, against the plainest dictates of
common sense, but in neither case would the sentiments of
the community be probably changed by the result. The
reverential feelings which alone could impart faith in the
system seem scarcely compatible with the practice of compounding
for ordeals, which, as we have seen above (p. 384),
was occasionally permitted.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, at the commencement of his reign, does not
seem to have entertained much respect for the judgment of
God when he prescribed the administration of the ordeal for
trifling affairs only, cases of magnitude being reserved for the
regular investigation of the law.<a id="FNanchor_1265_1265" href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> Thirty years later, the
public mind appears afflicted with the same doubts, for we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
find the monarch endeavoring to enforce confidence in the
system by his commands.<a id="FNanchor_1266_1266" href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> The repeated use of the ordeal in
the affair of the divorce of Teutberga shows that it was expected
to have no little effect on public opinion, and the same
is seen when in 876 Charlemagne’s grandson, Louis of Saxony,
forced to defend his dominions against his uncle Charles le
Chauve, commenced by proving the justness of his title by
the judgment of God. After fasting and prayer ten of his
followers were exposed to the ordeal of red-hot iron and ten
each to those of cold and boiling water; all escaped without
injury, and the righteousness of the verdict was shown soon
after by the victory of Andernach, which sent the invader
flying back to France.<a id="FNanchor_1267_1267" href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> Yet a rule of English law, nearly four
hundred years later, during the expiring struggles of the
practice, would show that the result was regarded as by no
means conclusive. By the assizes of Clarendon in 1166,
which directed that all malefactors defamed for murder,
robbery, and other felonies should be at once tried by the
water ordeal, it was provided that those who had confessed or
who had been found in possession of stolen property should
not be allowed the privilege of clearing themselves in this
manner; and a still more irreverential rule decreed that those
who were pronounced innocent by the judgment of God, if
regarded as guilty by common report, should have eight days
to quit the kingdom, under pain of outlawry.<a id="FNanchor_1268_1268" href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> In the revision
of these laws, made at Northampton ten years later, it was
provided that in all cases those who passed safely through the
ordeal should give bail for their future good conduct, except
in charges of murder or aggravated felony, when they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
banished within forty days, under penalty of outlawry as
before.<a id="FNanchor_1269_1269" href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a></p>

<p>St. Ivo of Chartres, though he had no scruple in recommending
and enjoining the ordeal for laymen, and, on one
occasion at least, pronounced its decisions as beyond appeal,
yet has placed on record his conviction of its insufficiency,
and his experience that the mysterious judgment of God not
infrequently allowed in this manner the guilty to escape and
the innocent to be punished.<a id="FNanchor_1270_1270" href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> A case related by Peter Cantor
in the twelfth century shows how recklessly it often was abused
as a relief to careless judges in doubtful cases. Two Englishmen
were returning in company from a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, when one of them wandered off to the shrine of
St. Jago de Compostella, and the other went directly home.
The kindred of the absent one accused the latter of murdering
his companion; as no evidence was procurable on either
side, he was hurried to the ordeal, convicted, and executed,
shortly after which the missing man came back in safety.<a id="FNanchor_1271_1271" href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a></p>

<p>The manifest injustice of the decisions thus rendered by the
ordeal put a severe strain on the faith of believers, and led
them to the most ingenious sophistry for an explanation.
When, in 1127, the sacrilegious murder of Charles the Good,
Count of Flanders, sent a thrill of horror throughout Europe,
Lambert of Redenberg, whose participation in the crime was
notorious, succeeded in clearing himself by the hot iron.
Shortly afterwards he undertook the siege of Ostbourg, which
he prosecuted with great cruelty, when he was killed in a sally
of the besieged. The pious Galbert assumes that Lambert,
notwithstanding his guilt, escaped at the ordeal in consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
of his humility and repentance, and philosophically adds:
“Thus it is that in battle the unjust man is killed, although
in the ordeal of water or of fire he may escape, if truly repentant.”<a id="FNanchor_1272_1272" href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a>
The same doctrine was enunciated under John
Cantacuzenes, in the middle of the fourteenth century, by a
bishop of Didymoteichos in Thrace. A frail fair one being
violently suspected by her husband, the ordeal of hot iron
was demanded by him. In this strait she applied to the good
bishop, and he, being convinced of her repentance and intention
to sin no more, assured her that in such a frame of
mind she might safely venture on the trial, and she accordingly
carried the glowing bar triumphantly twice around the bishop’s
chair, to the entire satisfaction of her lord and master.<a id="FNanchor_1273_1273" href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a></p>

<p>In fact it was a recognized doctrine of the Church that confession,
contrition, and absolution so thoroughly washed
away a sin that a culprit thus prepared could safely tempt the
justice of God. A case related by Cæsarius of Heisterbach
as a most edifying example illustrates the curious nature of
the superstition thus inculcated by the religious teachers of
the period. In the diocese of Utrecht a fisherman notoriously
maintained illicit relations with a woman, and fearing to be
called to account for it by an approaching synod, where he
would be convicted by the red-hot iron, and be forced to
marry her, he consulted a priest. This ghostly counsellor advised
him that, if he was firmly resolved to sin no more, he
could safely deny the fact and endure the ordeal, after receiving
absolution. The event verified the prediction; he carried
the burning iron unhurt, and to the surprise of all the country
round he was acquitted. Shortly afterwards, while in his boat,
a companion expressed his wonder, when the fisherman, whose
short-lived repentance was already over, boastingly struck his
hand on the water, exclaiming, “It hurt me no more than
that!” By the marvellous justice of God, the water was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
him as red-hot iron, and as he hastily withdrew his hand the
skin peeled off in strips.<a id="FNanchor_1274_1274" href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> Even as late as 1539, the learned
Ciruelo reproves the use of ordeals because the accused,
though innocent of the special crime at issue, may succumb
in consequence of other offences; or though guilty may escape
because he has confessed and received absolution; and he
states that he had personally known more than one case in
which women, rightly accused of adultery by their husbands
and forced to undergo the ordeal, had thus succeeded in being
acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_1275_1275" href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a></p>

<p>This doctrine of Ciruelo’s that the innocent were sometimes
liable to conviction on account of previous misdeeds was
likewise a belief of old standing. We have already seen (p.
137) that there was papal authority for it in the wager of
battle. A striking instance of the vague notions current is
afforded in the middle of the eleventh century by a case related
by Othlonus, in which a man accused of horse-stealing
was tried by the cold-water ordeal and found guilty. Knowing
his own innocence, he appealed to the surrounding monks,
and was told that it must be in consequence of some other sin
not properly redeemed by penance. As he had confessed and
received absolution before the trial, he denied this, till one of
them pointed out that in place of allowing his beard to grow,
as was meet for a layman, he had impiously carried the smooth
chin reserved for ecclesiastics. Confessing his guilt, promising
due penance, and vowing never to touch his beard with a razor
again, he was conducted a second time to the water, and being
now free from all unrepented sin, he was triumphantly acquitted.
It is added that, taking advantage of a quibble as to the kind
of instrument employed, he lapsed again into the sin of shaving,
when the anger of Heaven manifested itself by allowing
him to fall into the hands of an enemy, who put out his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_1276_1276" href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>Yet, on the other hand, the ordeal sometimes was regarded
as the most satisfactory kind of proof, entitled to respect
beyond any other species of evidence. The age was not
logical, men acted more from impulse than from reason, and
the forms of jurisprudence were still in a state too chaotic for
regular and invariable rules to be laid down. The confusion
existing in the popular mind is well illustrated by a case occurring
in the twelfth century. A serf of the Abbey of Marmoutiers
married a serf who had been given by the Viscount
of Blois to one of his retainers named Erbald. The husband
purchased his wife’s liberty, and by paying an additional sum
had the deed of manumission confirmed by the viscount and
viscountess. Years passed away, the serf and wife died, and
then also their son, when their property fell to the abbey,
which enjoyed it until the heirs of Erbald and the viscount
claimed it. The monks produced the deeds of manumission,
and the viscountess, then the only surviving witness to the
transaction, testified to its authenticity, but to no purpose.
The claimants demanded the wager of battle, and the monks,
in refusing this as unsuited to their calling, were obliged to
produce a man who offered to undergo the ordeal of red-hot
iron to prove the validity of the deed. Then the claimants
at last desisted, but still succeeded in extorting sixteen livres
from the abbey as the price of appending their signatures to
the controverted deed.<a id="FNanchor_1277_1277" href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a></p>

<p>In general, however, as the result depended mostly upon
those who administered the ordeal, it conferred an irresponsible
power to release or to condemn, and it would be expecting
too much of human nature to suppose that men did not
yield frequently to the temptation to abuse that power. When
Sigurd Thorlaksson was accused by Saint Olaf the King of
the murder of his foster-brother Thoralf, and offered to clear
himself by the red-hot iron, King Olaf accepted his offer, and
appointed the next day for the trial at Lygra, where the bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
was to preside over it. When Sigurd went back at night to
his ship, he said to his comrades that their prospects were
gloomy, for the king had probably caused himself the death
of Thoralf, and then brought the accusation against them,
adding, “For him, it is an easy matter to manage the iron
ordeal so that I doubt he will come ill off who tries it against
him;” whereupon they hoisted sail in the darkness and escaped
to their home in the Faroe Islands.<a id="FNanchor_1278_1278" href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> The collusion thus hinted
at must often have been practised, and must have shaken the
most robust faith, and this cause of disbelief would receive
additional strength from the fact that the result itself was not
seldom in doubt, victory being equally claimed by both parties.
Of this we have already seen examples in the affairs of
the lance of St. Andrew and of the Archbishop of Milan,
and somewhat similar is an incident recorded by the Bollandists
in the life of St. Swithin, in which, by miraculous interposition,
the opposing parties beheld entirely different results from
an appeal to the red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_1279_1279" href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a></p>

<p>Efforts of course were made from time to time to preserve
the purity of the appeal, and to secure impartiality in its application.
Clotair II., in 595, directs that three chosen persons
shall attend on each side to prevent collusion;<a id="FNanchor_1280_1280" href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> and among
the Anglo-Saxons, some four hundred years later, Ethelred
enjoins the presence of the prosecutor under penalty of loss of
suit and fine of twenty <i>ores</i>, apparently for the same object, as
well as to give authenticity to the decision.<a id="FNanchor_1281_1281" href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> So in Hungary,
the laws of St. Ladislas, in 1092, direct that three sworn witnesses
shall be present to attest the innocence or guilt of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
accused as demonstrated by the result.<a id="FNanchor_1282_1282" href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> A rule announced by
the Council of Grateley in 928, that if the accused is accompanied
by more than twelve comrades he shall be adjudged as
though he had failed in the ordeal, points to an obvious source
of miscarriage of justice by which a crowd of partisans could
interfere with the proceedings and then proclaim that the
result had been successful.<a id="FNanchor_1283_1283" href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> A law adopted by the Scottish
Parliament under William the Lion, in the second half of the

from receiving bribes to divert the course of justice,<a id="FNanchor_1284_1284" href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> and a
further precaution was taken by prohibiting the Barons from
adjudging the ordeal without the intervention of the sheriff to
see that law and justice were observed.<a id="FNanchor_1285_1285" href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a></p>

<p>In spite of all that we have seen, the ordeal, with its undoubted
cruelty, was not as cruel as it appears to us, and in
its practical results it probably acquitted the guilty far more
often than it convicted the innocent. Mr. Maitland tells us
that in his researches in the English records from 1201 till the
abolition of the ordeal in 1219—a period in which, as stated
above (p. 387), it was in constant use—he has found but one
instance in which it failed to clear the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1286_1286" href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a> It is true that
the cold-water ordeal was the one most freely resorted to, but
the red-hot iron was also freely employed, and the one case of
failure occurred in the water ordeal. At this distance of time
it would be useless to frame a positive explanation of this,
although bribery and collusion of course naturally suggest
themselves in the notorious and almost universal corruption of
the period. Contemporaries reconciled themselves to this as
best they could, but while relying comfortably upon the inscrutable
judgment of God, and the preservative power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
contrition and confession, they were not without other solutions
of the problem.</p>

<p>We have seen that in the judicial duel magic arts were
popularly supposed to have power to control the interposition
of God. This was likewise the case with the vulgar ordeals,
and in addition a special power was attributed to the use or
abuse of the holy chrism. The Council of Tours, in 813,
informs us that it was generally believed that a criminal who
drank the chrism or anointed himself with it could not be convicted
by any ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1287_1287" href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> So serious indeed was this considered
that Charlemagne in 809 decreed that a priest giving out the
chrism for this purpose should not only be degraded but
should lose a hand—a law which long continued in force,
nominally at least.<a id="FNanchor_1288_1288" href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> The belief was not ephemeral, for until
the early part of the twelfth century a canon was carried
through all the collections which speaks of the matter as a fact
proved by experience.<a id="FNanchor_1289_1289" href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> The superstition probably died out
towards the middle of the century when the number of sacraments
was increased from three to seven, and the comparative
importance of the chrism was thus diminished in the popular
eyes. The belief that the judgment of God could be perverted
or eluded by magic arts still continued, however, and
precautions were commonly taken to prevent their use.<a id="FNanchor_1290_1290" href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a> Holy
water, moreover, was lavishly sprinkled on the materials employed
in the ordeal and on the patient, and was given to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
to drink to prevent diabolic illusions by which it was imagined
that the purposes of God could be defeated.<a id="FNanchor_1291_1291" href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a></p>

<p>Precautions also were taken to guard against processes by
which, in the fire ordeals, it was believed that the human frame
could be rendered incombustible, and for this object a widely
prevailing custom required that for three days previous the hand
should be wrapped up to guard against its being thus fortified.<a id="FNanchor_1292_1292" href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a>
The nature of these unguents may be guessed from a prescription
given by Albertus Magnus, consisting of mallow and radish
juice, white of egg, lime, and “psillus” seeds, the use of which
he assures us will enable a man with impunity to enter the
flames or to carry red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_1293_1293" href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> Doubtless reliance on some
such expedients may partially explain the readiness with which
the ordeal was undertaken.</p>

<small>THE CHURCH AND THE ORDEAL.</small></h3>


<p>The relation of the Church to the vulgar ordeals presents
even a more complex question than that which has already
been discussed of its connection with the judicial combat.
The ordeals were less repugnant to its teachings and more
completely dependent upon its ministrations, for while a duel
might be fought without the aid of a priest the efficacy of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
ordeal depended wholly upon the religious rites which gave it
the sanction of a direct invocation of the Almighty.</p>

<p>We have seen above that the Church readily accepted the
pagan practices of its Barbarian converts, and gave them fresh
claim to confidence by surrounding them with the most impressive
solemnities of the faith. Notwithstanding the worldly
advantage derivable from this policy, there were some minds
superior to the superstition or the cunning of their fellows.
Even as early as the commencement of the sixth century,
Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, remonstrated freely with Gundobald
on account of the prominence given to the battle ordeal
in the Burgundian code; and some three centuries later, St.
Agobard, Archbishop of Lyons, attacked the whole system in
two powerful treatises, which in many points display a breadth
of view and clearness of reasoning far in advance of his age.<a id="FNanchor_1294_1294" href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a>
Shortly after this we find an echo of these arguments in some
utterances of the papacy, such as the disapproval of the lot by
Leo IV. (p. 353), of the duel by Nicholas I. (p. 207), and the
more general condemnation by Stephen V. (p. 395), while on
the other hand we have seen (p. 382) the ordeal adopted by
Stephen VII. in the trial of his predecessor Formosus.</p>

<p>Whether the Holy See condemned or approved the judgment
of God was a matter of the utmost indifference to the
Church at large. The universal use of the ordeal, involving
as it did the indispensable employment of priestly ministrations,
shows sufficiently that no ecclesiastic hesitated to sanction it,
and that practically it had the universal sympathy and support
of the Church. Nor was this left to be merely a matter
of inference, for the local churches had no scruple in advocating
and prescribing it in the most authoritative manner.
In 799 the Council of Salzburg ordered the red-hot iron for
the trial of witches and necromancers.<a id="FNanchor_1295_1295" href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> In 810, Ahyto, Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
of Basle, could suggest no other mode of determining doubtful
cases of consanguinity between husband and wife.<a id="FNanchor_1296_1296" href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> In 853,
the Synod of Soissons ordered Burchard, Bishop of Chartres,
to prove his fitness for the episcopal office by undergoing the
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1297_1297" href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims, lent to it all the
influence of his commanding talents and position; the Council
of Mainz in 888, and that of Tribur near Mainz in 895,
recommended it; that of Tours in 925 ordered it for the decision
of a quarrel between two priests respecting certain tithes;<a id="FNanchor_1298_1298" href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a>
the synod of the province of Mainz in 1028 authorized the hot
iron in a case of murder;<a id="FNanchor_1299_1299" href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> that of Elne in 1065 recognized it;
that of Auch in 1068 confirmed its use; a penitential of the
same period in Bohemia ordered the ordeal for those who
pleaded ignorance when accused of marrying within the prohibited
degrees;<a id="FNanchor_1300_1300" href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> Burckhardt, Bishop of Worms, whose collection
of canons enjoyed high authority, in 1023 assisted at
the Council of Selingenstadt, which directed its employment,
and in his penitential he prescribes five years’ penance for endeavoring
by magic arts to escape conviction by it—a practice
which, as we have seen, was not uncommon.<a id="FNanchor_1301_1301" href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> The synod
of Gran, in 1099, decided that the ordeal of hot iron might
be administered during Lent, except in cases involving the
shedding of blood.<a id="FNanchor_1302_1302" href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> Moreover, we find St. Bernard alluding
approvingly to the conviction and martyrdom of heretics by
the cold-water process,<a id="FNanchor_1303_1303" href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> of which Guibert de Nogent gives us
an instance wherein he aided the Bishop of Soissons in admin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>istering
it to two backsliders with complete success.<a id="FNanchor_1304_1304" href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a> In 1157
the red-hot iron ordeal was prescribed by the Council of Reims
for all persons accused of belonging to the fast-growing sect of
the Cathari or Manichæans, whose progress was alarming the
Church;<a id="FNanchor_1305_1305" href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> and in 1167 two heretics at Vezelai were tried by
cold water in the presence of the Archbishop of Lyons and
two bishops, when, singularly enough, they escaped.<a id="FNanchor_1306_1306" href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> In 1172
a learned clerk named Robert was involved in a debate with a
knight on the delicate question whether the Eucharist became
corrupted when voided from the body: he was accused as a
heretic to the Bishop of Arras, who called in the Archbishop
of Reims and numerous clerks to try him. Robert was so
confident of his innocence that he offered to undergo the hot-iron
ordeal, but his guilt was miraculously shown when burns
appeared not only on the right hand that carried the iron, but
also on the left hand, on both feet, both sides and on his chest
and belly, wherefore he was promptly burned alive as a heretic.<a id="FNanchor_1307_1307" href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a>
Other cases, moreover, are related by Peter Cantor, in which
good Catholics were successfully convicted of heresy in this
manner, and one instance presents a curious view of the singular
confusion which existed in judicial logic at the time.
A poor fellow who professed the most entire orthodoxy, and
against whom there was no proof, was ordered to carry the
red-hot iron. This he refused unless the assembled bishops
would prove that he could do so without incurring mortal sin
by tempting God. This they were unable to accomplish, so
all unpleasant doubts were settled by promptly having him
burnt.<a id="FNanchor_1308_1308" href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> Even after the Lateran Council of 1215, some miracles
related by Cæsarius of Heisterbach show that the conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
of heretics by the hot iron was regarded as a matter of course,<a id="FNanchor_1309_1309" href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a>
and a penitential of a somewhat later period complains that
suspected heretics on trial had no other means of proving their
orthodoxy or their conversion to the true faith. It also mentions
a curious custom prevalent in some places that where
there was doubt as to a man having died in grace, his friends
had to prove his penitence by undergoing the cold-water ordeal
before he was admitted to Christian sepulture.<a id="FNanchor_1310_1310" href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a></p>

<p>Prelates, moreover, were everywhere found granting charters
containing the privilege of conducting trials in this manner.
It was sometimes specially appropriated to members of
the Church, who claimed it, under the name of <i>Lex Monachorum</i>,
as a class privilege exempting them from being parties
to the more barbarous and uncanonical wager of battle,<a id="FNanchor_1311_1311" href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a>
and in 1061 a charter of John, Bishop of Avranches, to the
Abbot of Mont S. Michel, alludes to hot water and iron as
the only mode of trying priests charged with offences of magnitude.<a id="FNanchor_1312_1312" href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a>
St. Ivo of Chartres, who denied the liability of churchmen
to the ordeal, admitted that it could be properly used on
laymen, and even pronounces its result to be beyond appeal.<a id="FNanchor_1313_1313" href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a>
Pope Calixtus II. in 1119 gave his sanction to it at the Council
of Reims, and soon afterwards at the Council of Chartres
he admitted the red-hot iron to decide a case of alleged violation
of the right of asylum in a church.<a id="FNanchor_1314_1314" href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a> About the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
the learned priest, Honorius of Autun, specifies the benediction
of the iron and water of the ordeal as part of the legitimate
functions of his order;<a id="FNanchor_1315_1315" href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> and even Gratian, in 1151, hesitates
to condemn the whole system, preferring to consider the
canon of Stephen V. as prohibiting only the ordeals of hot
water and iron.<a id="FNanchor_1316_1316" href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a></p>

<p>The Church, in fact, lent its most impressive ceremonies to
enhance the effect on the popular mind of these trials. An
<i>Ordo</i> or Ritual, of about the year 1100, informs us that when
any one accused of theft or adultery or other crime refused to
confess, the priest was to go to the church, put on his sacred
vestments, except the chasuble, and then, holding the gospels
and chrismatory, the chalice and paten and relics of saints, he
from the vestibule summoned the people, while forbidding the
accused, if guilty, and any of his accomplices to enter. At
the same time he designated the spot in the vestibule where
the fire was to be built to heat the caldron or the ploughshares,
and sprinkled them all with holy water to prevent diabolical
illusions. Then the accused entered. He was first
required to forgive all offences as he hoped for pardon; he
made confession of his sins and accepted penance, while the
penitential psalms were sung customary for penitents on Ash
Wednesday; if there was suspicion as to his faith he was made
to swear on the altar his reliance on God rather than on the
devil to manifest his innocence in the ordeal. Mass was then
celebrated and communion was administered to him under the
tremendous adjuration, “May the body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ be unto thee a proof!” After this the priest led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
people to the spot where the trial was to take place. Prayers
were uttered to God to render judgment, litanies and psalms
were sung, the material of the ordeal, whether iron or hot or
cold water, was blessed with an adjuration that it would be
the means of rendering a just verdict, and the accused was
exorcised with an adjuration to abandon the trial if he was
conscious of guilt. Then the oath was administered to him,
and he took hold of the glowing iron, or plunged his hand
into the seething caldron, or was bound and cast into the
water. Nothing was omitted that would add to the effectiveness
of the prolonged ritual, and throughout it was in the
hands of the priest; the secular tribunal effaced itself and
abandoned the whole conduct of the affair to the Church.<a id="FNanchor_1317_1317" href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a></p>

<p>Gradually, however, the papacy ranged itself in opposition
to the ordeal. After a silence of nearly two centuries, Alexander
II., about 1070, denounced it as a popular invention,
destitute of canonical authority, and forbade its use for ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_1318_1318" href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a>
This was a claim which had already in the eighth
century been advanced in England by Ecgbehrt, Archbishop
of York, who piously declared that their oath on the cross was
sufficient for acquittal, and that if guilty their punishment
must be left to God.<a id="FNanchor_1319_1319" href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> About the year 1000, St. Abbo of
Fleury revived this assertion of exemption,<a id="FNanchor_1320_1320" href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> and a century
later St. Ivo of Chartres insisted on it.<a id="FNanchor_1321_1321" href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> As we have seen,
these demands for clerical immunity were wholly disregarded,
but they serve as a key to the motive of the papal opposition
to the ordeal which developed itself so rapidly in the second
half of the twelfth century. The Church had long sought,
with little practical result, to emancipate the clergy from subjection
to the secular law. This was one of the leading objects
of the forgers of the Pseudo-Isidorian decretals; it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
met with promising success at the time;<a id="FNanchor_1322_1322" href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> in the confusion of
the tenth and eleventh centuries it had well-nigh been forgotten,
but now it was revived and insisted on with a persistent
energy which won the victory in the thirteenth century. When
this point was gained and ecclesiastics were relieved from ordeals
and duels, the next step was inevitably to extend the
prohibition to the laity. The papal battle was really fought
for the advantage of the clergy, but the clergy was ranged in
opposition because the prospective benefit seemed inadequate
to compensate for present loss. The local churches found in
the administration of the ordeal a source of power and profit
which naturally rendered them unwilling to abandon it at the
papal mandate. Chartered privileges had accumulated around
it, such as we have already seen in the case of the judicial
duel, and these privileges were shared or held by prelates and
churches and monasteries. Thus in 1148 we find Thibaut the
Great of Champagne making over to the church of St. Mary
Magdalen the exclusive right of administering the oaths required
on such occasions in the town of Chateaudun;<a id="FNanchor_1323_1323" href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> and
in 1182 the Vicomte de Béarn conferred on the Abbey de la
Seauve the revenue arising from the marble basin used for the
trial by boiling water at Gavarret.<a id="FNanchor_1324_1324" href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> In the statutes of King
Coloman of Hungary, collected in 1099, there is a provision
prohibiting the administration of the ordeal in the smaller
churches, and reserving the privilege to the cathedral seats
and other important establishments.<a id="FNanchor_1325_1325" href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a></p>

<p>According to a grant from Péregrin de Lavedan to the monastery
of Saint-Pé, in Bigorre, the fee for administering the hot-water
ordeal was five crowns, of which two were paid to the
monastery, two to the cathedral at Tarbes, and one to the
priest who blessed the water and stone.<a id="FNanchor_1326_1326" href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> By the laws of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
Ladislas of Hungary, in 1092, the stipend of the officiating
priest for the red-hot iron was double that which he received
for the water ordeal;<a id="FNanchor_1327_1327" href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> in Bohemia the laws of Otto Premizlas
in 1229 give the priest a fee of fourteen deniers for the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1328_1328" href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a>
How rigidly these rights were enforced is shown in a case related
by Peter Cantor in the twelfth century. A man accused
of crime was sentenced to undergo the ordeal of cold water.
When stripped and bound and seated on the edge of the tank,
the prosecutor withdrew the suit, but the official of the court
refused to release the accused until he should pay fees amounting
to nine livres and a half. A long wrangle ensued, until
the defendant declared that he would pay nothing, but would
rather undergo the ordeal, and, after establishing his innocence,
would give fifty sols to the poor. He was accordingly
thrown in and sank satisfactorily, but on being drawn out was
met with a fresh claim from the officiating priest, of five sols,
for blessing the water.<a id="FNanchor_1329_1329" href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a></p>

<p>As these fees were paid, sometimes on conviction and sometimes
on acquittal, there was danger that, even without direct
bribery, self-interest might affect the result. Thus by the acts
of the Synod of Lillebonne, in 1080, a conviction by the
hot-iron ordeal entailed a fine for the benefit of the bishop;<a id="FNanchor_1330_1330" href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a>
and it was apparently to prevent such influences that the
Swedish code, compiled by Andreas Archbishop of Lunden
early in the thirteenth century, made the successful party,
whether the prosecutor or defendant, pay the fee to the
officiating priest—a regulation sufficiently degrading to the
sacerdotal character.<a id="FNanchor_1331_1331" href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> But besides these pecuniary advan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>tages,
the ordeal had a natural attraction to the clergy, as it
afforded the means of awing the laity, by rendering the priest
a special instrument of Divine justice, into whose hands every
man felt that he was at any moment liable to fall; while, to
the unworthy, its attractions were enhanced by the opportunities
which it gave for the worst abuses. From the decretals
of Alexander III. we learn authoritatively that the extortion
of money from innocent persons by its instrumentality was a
notorious fact<a id="FNanchor_1332_1332" href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a>—a testimony confirmed by Ekkehardus Junior,
who, a century earlier, makes the same accusation, and moreover
inveighs bitterly against the priests who were wont to
gratify the vilest instincts in stripping women for the purpose
of exposing them to the ordeal of cold water.<a id="FNanchor_1333_1333" href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a></p>

<p>With all these influences, moral and material, to give to the
local clergy a direct interest in the maintenance of the ordeal,
it is no wonder that they battled resolutely for its preservation.
In this, however, as in so many other details of ecclesiastical
policy, centralization triumphed. When the papal authority
reached its culminating point, a vigorous and sustained effort
to abolish the whole system was made by the popes who
occupied the pontifical throne from 1159 to 1227. Nothing
can be more peremptory than the prohibition uttered by Alexander
III.,<a id="FNanchor_1334_1334" href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> who sought moreover to enlist on his side the
local churches by stigmatizing as an intolerable abuse the
liability which in Sweden forced the highest prelates to sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>mit
to the red-hot iron ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1335_1335" href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> About the same time we find
the celebrated Peter Cantor earnestly urging that it was a sinful
tempting of God and a most uncertain means of administering
justice, which he enforces by numerous instances of
innocent persons who, within his own knowledge, had been
condemned by its means and put to death; and he declares
that any priest exorcising the iron or water, or administering
the oaths preliminary to the judicial duel, is guilty of mortal
sin.<a id="FNanchor_1336_1336" href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a> Somewhat earlier than this, Ekkehard Bishop of Munster
took the same ground when he refused to his steward Richmar
permission to undergo the red-hot iron ordeal in order to convert
the Jew, Hermann of Cologne; it would be, he said, a
tempting of God.<a id="FNanchor_1337_1337" href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> A different reason was given when Albero,
a priest of Mercke near Cologne, offered to pass through fire
to prove the orthodoxy of his teaching that the sacraments
were vitiated in the hands of sinful priests, and his request
was refused on the ground that skilful sorcery might thus lead
to the success of a flagrant heresy.<a id="FNanchor_1338_1338" href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a> In 1181, Lucius III.
pronounced null and void the acquittal of a priest charged
with homicide, who had undergone the water ordeal, and
ordered him to prove his innocence with compurgators, giving
as a reason that all such “peregrina judicia” were prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_1339_1339" href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a>
Even more severe was the blow administered by Innocent III.
early in the thirteenth century. At Albenga, near Genoa, a
man suspected of theft offered to prove his innocence by the
red-hot iron, and agreed to be hanged if he should fail. The
ordeal took place in the presence of the bishop and judge;
the man’s hand was burnt and after some consultation the
bishop ordered him to be hanged. When Innocent heard of
this he promptly had the bishop deprived of his see and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
successor elected; his decision in this case was carried into the
canon law as a precedent to be followed.<a id="FNanchor_1340_1340" href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> In 1210, moreover,
when Bishop Henry of Strassburg was vigorously persecuting
heresy and convicting heretics by the ordeal, one of them
named Reinhold hurried to Rome and returned with a letter
from Innocent forbidding it for the future; ordeals might be
adjudged, he said, by the secular tribunals, but they were not
admissible in ecclesiastical judgments.<a id="FNanchor_1341_1341" href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a> Still more effective
was his action when, under his impulsion, the Fourth Council
of Lateran, in 1215, formally forbade the employment of any
ecclesiastical ceremonies in such trials.<a id="FNanchor_1342_1342" href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a> As the moral influence
of the ordeal depended entirely upon its religious associations,
a strict observance of this canon must speedily have swept the
whole system into oblivion. Yet shortly after this we find the
inquisitor Conrad of Marburg employing in Germany the red-hot
iron as a means of condemning his unfortunate victims by
wholesale, and the chronicler relates that, whether innocent or
guilty, few escaped the test.<a id="FNanchor_1343_1343" href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> The canon of Lateran, however,
was actively followed up by the papal legates, and the
system may consequently be considered to have fairly entered
on its decline.</p>

<p>So far as the Church was concerned its condemnation was
irrevocable. By this time the papacy had become the supreme
and unquestioned legislator. The compilation of papal decrees
known as the Decretals of Gregory IX., issued in 1234,
was everywhere accepted as the “new law” of binding force,
and in it the compiler, St. Ramon de Peñafort, had sedulously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
inserted the prohibitions so repeatedly issued during the preceding
three-quarters of a century. These prohibitions were
no longer construed as limited to ecclesiastics; the whole
system was condemned. St. Ramon himself in his <i>Summa</i>,
which had immense and lasting authority, had no hesitation
in denouncing all ordeals as an accursed invention of the devil.<a id="FNanchor_1344_1344" href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a>
His contemporary, Alexander Hales, whose reputation as a
theologian stood unrivalled, after presenting the arguments on
both sides, concludes that they are wholly to be rejected.<a id="FNanchor_1345_1345" href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a>
Soon afterwards Cardinal Henry of Susa, the leading canonist
of his day, gave a severer blow by proving that as ordeals are
illegal all sentences rendered by their means are null and void.<a id="FNanchor_1346_1346" href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a>
Still the practice was hard to suppress, for at the end of the
century we find John of Freiburg denouncing it as forbidden
and accursed; bishops and abbots permitting ordeals in
their courts are guilty of mortal sin, and preachers should denounce
them from their pulpits with all due modesty.<a id="FNanchor_1347_1347" href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> This
shows that the spiritual lords were still deaf to the voice of the
papacy, but the principle was settled and in 1317 Astesanus,
whose authority was of the highest, treats the whole system
of duels and ordeals as mere appeals to chance, having no
warrant in divine law and forbidden by the Church.<a id="FNanchor_1348_1348" href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> This
attitude was consistently preserved, and Gregory XI. in 1374,
when condemning the Sachsenspiegel, enumerated, among other
objectionable features, its provisions of this nature as contrary
to the canon law and a tempting of God.<a id="FNanchor_1349_1349" href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a></p>

<small>REPRESSIVE SECULAR LEGISLATION.</small></h3>


<p>Enlightened legislators were not slow in seconding the
efforts of the papacy. Perhaps the earliest instance of secular
legislation directed against the ordeal, except some charters
granted to communes, is an edict of Philip Augustus in 1200,
bestowing certain privileges on the scholars of the University
of Paris, by which he ordered that a citizen accused of assaulting
a student shall not be allowed to defend himself either by
the duel or the water ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1350_1350" href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> In England, a rescript of
Henry III., dated January 27, 1219, directs the judges then
starting on their circuits to employ other modes of proof—“seeing
that the judgment of fire and water is forbidden by
the Church of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_1351_1351" href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> A few charters and confirmations,
dated some years subsequently, allude to the privilege of administering
it; but Matthew of Westminster, when enumerating,
under date of 1250, the remarkable events of the half
century, specifies its abrogation as one of the occurrences to
be noted,<a id="FNanchor_1352_1352" href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> and we may conclude that thenceforth it was practically
abandoned throughout the kingdom. This is confirmed
by the fact that Bracton, whose treatise was written a few
years later, refers only to the wager of battle as a legal procedure,
and, when alluding to other forms, speaks of them as
things of the past. About the same time, Alexander II. of
Scotland forbade its use in cases of theft.<a id="FNanchor_1353_1353" href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a> Nearly con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>temporary
was the Neapolitan Code, promulgated in 1231, by
authority of the Emperor Frederic II., in which he not only
prohibits the use of the ordeal in all cases, but ridicules, in a
very curious passage, the folly of those who could place confidence
in it.<a id="FNanchor_1354_1354" href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a> We may conclude, however, that this was not
effectual in eradicating it, for, fifty years later, Charles of
Anjou found it necessary to repeat the injunction.<a id="FNanchor_1355_1355" href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> About
the same time, Waldemar II. of Denmark, Hako Hakonsen of
Iceland and Norway; and soon afterwards Birger Jarl of
Sweden, followed the example.<a id="FNanchor_1356_1356" href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a> In Frisia we learn that the inhabitants
still refused to obey the papal mandates, and insisted
on retaining the red-hot iron, a contumacy which Emo, the
contemporary Abbot of Wittewerum, cites as one of the
causes of the terrible inundation of 1219;<a id="FNanchor_1357_1357" href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> though a century
later the Laws of Upstallesboom show that ordeals of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
kinds had fallen into desuetude.<a id="FNanchor_1358_1358" href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> In France, we find no
formal abrogation promulgated; but the contempt into which
the system had fallen is abundantly proved by the fact that in
the ordinances and books of practice issued during the latter
half of the century, such as the <i>Établissements</i> of St. Louis,
the <i>Conseil</i> of Pierre de Fontaines, the <i>Coutumes du Beauvoisis</i>
of Beaumanoir, and the <i>Livres de Jostice et de Plet</i>,
its existence is not recognized even by a prohibitory allusion,
the judicial duel thenceforward monopolizing the province of
irregular evidence. Indeed, a Latin version of the Coutumier
of Normandy, dating about the middle of the thirteenth
century, or a little earlier, speaks of it as a mode of proof
formerly employed in cases where one of the parties was a
woman who could find no champion to undergo the wager of
battle, adding that it had been forbidden by the Church, and
that such cases were then determined by inquests.<a id="FNanchor_1359_1359" href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a></p>

<p>Germany was more tardy in yielding to the mandates of the
Church. The Teutonic knights who wielded their proselyting
swords in the Marches of Prussia introduced the ordeal among
other Christian observances, and in 1222 Honorius III., at the
prayer of the Livonian converts, promulgated a decree by
which he strictly interdicted its use for the future.<a id="FNanchor_1360_1360" href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> Even in
1279 we find the Council of Buda, and in 1298 that of Wurzburg,
obliged to repeat the prohibition uttered by that of
Lateran.<a id="FNanchor_1361_1361" href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> These commands enjoyed little respect, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
independent spirit of the Empire still refused obedience to the
commands of the Church. It may probably be to Germany
that Roger Bacon refers, about this time, when he speaks of
the ordeals of red-hot iron and cold water being still in use by
authority of the Church, and admits that the exorcisms employed
in them by the priests may have virtue in the detection
of guilt and acquittal of innocence.<a id="FNanchor_1362_1362" href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> Even in the fourteenth
century the ancestral customs were preserved in full vigor as
regular modes of procedure in a manual of legal practice still
extant. An accusation of homicide could be disproved only
by the judicial combat, while in other felonies a man of bad
repute had no other means of escape than by undergoing the
trial by hot water or iron.<a id="FNanchor_1363_1363" href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a></p>

<p>In Aragon, Don Jayme I. included the ordeal in his prohibition
of the duel when framing laws for his Minorcan conquest
in 1230, and that this was his settled policy is seen by a
similar clause of the fuero of Huesca in 1247.<a id="FNanchor_1364_1364" href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> In Castile
and Leon, the charter of Medina de Pomar, granted in 1219
by Fernando III., provides that there shall be no trial by the
hot-water ordeal,<a id="FNanchor_1365_1365" href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a> and that of Treviño in 1254, by Alfonso X.,
forbids all ordeals.<a id="FNanchor_1366_1366" href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> Still the Council of Palencia, in 1322,
was obliged to threaten with excommunication all concerned
in administering the ordeal of fire or of water,<a id="FNanchor_1367_1367" href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> which proves
how little had been accomplished by the enlightened code of
the “Partidas,” issued about 1260 by Alfonso the Wise. In
this the burden of proof is expressly thrown upon the com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>plainant,
and no negative evidence is demanded of the defendant,
who is specially exempted from the necessity of producing
it;<a id="FNanchor_1368_1368" href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> and although in obedience to the chivalrous spirit
of the age, the battle ordeal is not abolished, yet it is so
limited as to be practically a dead letter, while no other form
of negative proof is even alluded to.</p>

<p>In Italy, even in the middle of the fifteenth century St.
Antonino of Florence considers it necessary, in his instructions
to confessors, to tell them that a judge who prescribes the
combat or the red-hot iron commits mortal sin;<a id="FNanchor_1369_1369" href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> and Angelo
da Chiavasco, who died in 1485, requires confessors to inquire
of penitents whether they have ordered or accepted the hot-iron
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_1370_1370" href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> Even as late as 1599 G. Ferretti tells us that in
some districts of Naples, inhabited by Epirotes, husbands who
suspect their wives of adultery force them to prove their innocence
by the ordeal of red-hot iron or boiling water.<a id="FNanchor_1371_1371" href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a></p>

<p>Although the ordeal was thus removed from the admitted
jurisprudence of Europe, the principles of faith which had
given it vitality were too deeply implanted in the popular mind
to be at once eradicated, and accordingly, as we have seen
above, instances of its employment continued occasionally for
several centuries to disgrace the tribunals. The ordeal of
battle, indeed, as shown in the preceding essay, was not
legally abrogated until long afterward; and the longevity of
the popular belief, upon which the whole system was founded,
may be gathered from a remark of Sir William Staundford, a
learned judge and respectable legal authority, who, in 1557,
expresses the same confident expectation of Divine interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
which had animated Hincmar or Poppo. After stating that
in an accusation of felony, unsupported by evidence, the defendant
had a right to wager his battle, he proceeds: “Because
in that the appellant demands judgment of death against
the appellee, it is more reasonable that he should hazard his
life with the defendant for the trial of it, than to put it on the
country ... and to leave it to God, to whom all things are
open, to give the verdict in such case, <i>scilicet</i>, by attributing
the victory or vanquishment to the one party or the other, as
it pleaseth Him.”<a id="FNanchor_1372_1372" href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a> Nearly about the same time, Ciruelo, who
for thirty years was Inquisitor at Saragossa, alludes to cases in
which he had personally known of its employment, thus showing
that it was in popular use, even though not prescribed by
the law, in Spain during the middle of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1373_1373" href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a>
In Germany not long before the learned Aventinus showed
plainly that the existing incredulity which treated all such
reliance on God as insanity was much less to his taste than the
pious trust which through ages of faith had led princes and
prelates to place their hope in God and invoke him with all
the solemnities of religion to decide where human wisdom was
at fault.<a id="FNanchor_1374_1374" href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the prohibitions uttered by the papacy had undoubtedly
much to do in influencing monarchs to abolish the ordeal,
there were other causes of scarcely less weight working to the
same end. The revival of the Roman law in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the introduction of torture as an unfailing
expedient in doubtful cases did much to influence the
secular tribunals against all ordeals. So, also, a powerful
assistant must be recognized in the rise of the communes,
whose sturdy common sense not infrequently rejected its absurdity.
These influences, however, have been discussed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
some length in the previous essay, and it is scarce worth while
to repeat what has there been said, except to add that, as a
recognized legal procedure, the ordeal succumbed with a less
prolonged struggle than the single combat.</p>

<p>Yet no definite period can be assigned to the disappearance
in any country of the appeals to Heaven handed down from
our ancestors in the illimitable past. We have seen above
how certain forms of the ordeal, such as bier-right and the trial
by cold water, have lingered virtually to our own times, though
long since displaced from the statute-book; and we should err
if we deemed the prohibition of the system by lawgivers to
be either the effect or the cause of a change in the constitution
of the human mind. The mysterious attraction of the unknown,
the striving for the unattainable, the yearning to connect
our mortal nature with some supernal power—all these
mixed motives assist in maintaining the superstitions which
we have thus passed in review. Even though the external
manifestations may have been swept away, the potent agencies
which vivified them have remained, not perhaps less active
because they work more secretly. One generation of follies
after another, strangely affiliated, waits on the successive
descendants of man, and perpetuates in another shape the
superstition which seemed to be eradicated. In its most
vulgar and abhorrent form, we recognize it in the fearful epidemic
of sorcery and witchcraft which afflicted the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries; sublimed to the verge of heaven,
we see it reappear in the seraphic theories of Quietism; descending
again towards earth, it stimulates the mad vagaries
of the Convulsionnaires. In a different guise, it leads the
refined scepticism of the eighteenth century to a belief in the
supernatural powers of the divining rod, which could not only
trace out hidden springs and deep-buried mines, but could
also discover crime, and follow the malefactor through all the
doublings of his cunning flight.<a id="FNanchor_1375_1375" href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> Even at the present day, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
various references in the preceding pages sufficiently attest,
there is a lurking undercurrent of superstition which occasionally
rises into view and shows that we are not yet exempt
from the weakness of the past. Each age has its own sins
and follies to answer for—happiest that which best succeeds
in hiding them, for it can scarce do more. Here, at the close
of the nineteenth century, when the triumph of human intelligence
over the forces of nature, stimulating the progress of
material prosperity, has deluded us into sacrificing our psychical
to our intellectual being—even here the duality of our
nature reasserts itself, and in the crudity of Mormonism
and in the fantastic mysteries of spiritism we see a protest
against the despotism of mere reason. If we wonder at these
perversions of our noblest attributes, we must remember that
the intensity of the reaction measures the original strain, and
in the insanities of the day we thus may learn how utterly we
have forgotten the Divine warning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span> “Man shall not live by
bread alone!”</p>

<small>TORTURE IN EGYPT AND ASIA.</small></h3>


<p>The preceding essays have traced the development of sacramental
purgation and of the ordeal as resources devised by
human ingenuity and credulity when called upon to decide
questions too intricate for the impatient intellect of a rude
and semi-barbarous age. There was another mode, however,
of attaining the same object which has received the sanction
of the wisest lawgivers during the greater part of the world’s
history, and our survey of man’s devious wanderings in the
search of truth would be incomplete without glancing at the
subject of the judicial use of torture. The ordeal and torture,
in fact, are virtually substitutes for each other. It will be seen
that they have rarely coexisted, and that, as a general rule,
the legislation which depended on the one rejected the other.</p>

<p>In the early stages of society, the judge or the pleader whose
faith does not lead him to rely upon an appeal to God naturally
seeks to extort from the reluctant witness a statement of
what he might desire to conceal, or from the presumed criminal
a confession of his guilt. To accomplish this, the readiest
means would seem to be the infliction of pain, to escape from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
which the witness would sacrifice his friends, and the accused
would submit to the penalty of his crime. The means of administering
graduated and effectual torment would thus be
sought for, and the rules for its application would in time be
developed into a regular system, forming part of the recognized
principles of jurisprudence.</p>

<p>In the earliest civilization, that of Egypt, it would seem as
though torture was too opposed to the whole theory of judicial
proceedings to be employed, if we are to believe the description
which Diodorus Siculus gives of the solemn and mysterious
tribunals, where written pleadings alone were allowed,
lest the judges should be swayed by the eloquence of the
human voice, and where the verdict was announced, in the
unbroken silence, by the presiding judge touching the successful
suitor with an image of the Goddess of Truth.<a id="FNanchor_1376_1376" href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a> Yet a
papyrus recently interpreted gives us a judicial record of a
trial, in the reign of Rameses IX. of the XXth Dynasty (circa
1200 B. C.), of the robbers of the tomb of the Pharaoh Sebakemsauf,
and this shows how the accused, after confession,
were tortured for confirmation, first by scourging and then by
squeezing the hands and feet, showing that, sometimes at
least, this mode of ascertaining the truth was employed.<a id="FNanchor_1377_1377" href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a></p>

<p>Among the Semitic races we find torture used as a regular
judicial process by the Assyrians,<a id="FNanchor_1378_1378" href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> though the Mosaic jurisprudence
is free from any indication that the Hebrew law-dispensers
regarded it as a legitimate expedient. Earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
advocates of the torture system, in the eighteenth century,
however, did not hesitate to adduce the ordeal of the bitter
water of jealousy as a torture which justified the employment
in modern times of the rack and strappado.</p>

<p>In the earliest Aryan records, so far as we can judge from
the fragments remaining of the Zoroastrian law, torture had no
recognized place. Astyages was rather a Mede than a Persian,
and therefore no conclusion can be drawn from his readiness
to employ it when he sought to extort the truth from unwilling
witnesses, as related by Herodotus;<a id="FNanchor_1379_1379" href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> but the savage punishments
which Darius boasts of inflicting upon the rival pretenders
to his throne<a id="FNanchor_1380_1380" href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> presuppose a readiness to resort to the
most violent means of intimidation, which could scarcely fail
to include torture as an extra-judicial means of investigation
when milder methods failed.</p>

<p>To the other great branch of the Aryan stock which founded
the Indian civilization, torture would likewise seem to have
been unknown as a legitimate resource; at least it has left no
trace of its existence in the elaborate provisions of the Hindu
law as handed down to us for nearly three thousand years.
In the Institutes of Manu there are very minute directions as
to evidence, the testimony preferred being that of witnesses,
whose comparative credibility is very carefully discussed, and
when such evidence is not attainable, the parties, as we have
seen above, are ordered to be sworn or tried by the ordeal.
These principles have been transmitted unchanged to the
present day.<a id="FNanchor_1381_1381" href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a></p>

<p>In China the juristic principles in force would seem to allow
no place for the use of torture (<i>ante</i>, p. 251), though doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
it may be occasionally resorted to as an extra-judicial expedient.
In Japan it still retains its place in the criminal codes,
though we may well believe the assertion that practically its
use has been discarded in the progress of modern enlightenment.
As to its former employment, however, the directions
are very explicit. In the milder form of scourging it might
be used in all preliminary examinations. Where reasonable
moral certainty existed of guilt in serious and capital crimes,
the severer inflictions, by fire, by various mechanical devices,
by deprivation of food and sleep or by exposure to venomous
reptiles, could be invoked to extort confession, the accused
being notified in advance that it would be used if he persisted
in asserting his innocence, and the official ordering it being
held personally responsible for its undue or improper employment.<a id="FNanchor_1382_1382" href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a></p>

<small>GREECE AND ROME.</small></h3>


<p>The absence of torture from the codes of the elder Aryan
races is not to be attributed to any inherent objection to its use,
but rather to the employment of the ordeal, which in all ages
formed part of their jurisprudence, and served as an unfailing
resort in all doubtful cases. When we turn to the Aryans who
established themselves in Europe and abandoned the ancestral
custom of the ordeal, we find it at once replaced by the use of
torture. Thus in Greece torture was thoroughly understood and
permanently established. The oligarchical and aristocratic
tendencies, however, which were so strongly developed in the
Hellenic commonwealths, imposed upon it a limitation characteristic
of the pride and self-respect of the governing order.
As a general rule, no freeman could be tortured. Even freed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>men
enjoyed an exemption, and it was reserved for the unfortunate
class of slaves, and for strangers who formed no part
of the body politic. Yet there were exceptions, as among the
Rhodians, whose laws authorized the torture of free citizens;
and in other states it was occasionally resorted to, in the case
of flagrant political offences; while the people, acting in their
supreme and irresponsible authority, could at any time decree
its application to any one irrespective of privilege. Thus,
when Hipparchus was assassinated by Harmodius, Aristogiton
was tortured to obtain a revelation of the plot, and several
similar proceedings are related by Valerius Maximus as occurring
among the Hellenic nations.<a id="FNanchor_1383_1383" href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> The inhuman torments
inflicted on Philotas, son of Parmenio, when accused of conspiracy
against Alexander, show how little real protection
existed when the safety of a despot was in question; and
illustrations of torture decreed by the people are to be seen
in the proceedings relative to the mutilation of the statues of
Hermes, and in the proposition, on the trial of Phocion, to
put him, the most eminent citizen of Athens, on the rack.</p>

<p>In a population consisting largely of slaves, who were generally
of the same race as their masters, often men of education
and intelligence and employed in positions of confidence, legal
proceedings must frequently have turned upon their evidence,
in both civil and criminal cases. Their evidence, however,
was inadmissible, except when given under torture, and then,
by a singular confusion of logic, it was estimated as the most
convincing kind of testimony. Consequently, the torturing
of slaves formed an important portion of the administration
of Athenian justice. Either party to a suit might offer his
slaves to the torturer or demand those of his opponent, and
a refusal to produce them was regarded as seriously compromising.
When both parties tendered their slaves, the judge
decided as to which of them should be received. Even without
bringing a suit into court, disputants could have their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
slaves tortured for evidence with which to effect an amicable
settlement.</p>

<p>In formal litigation, the defeated suitor paid whatever
damages his adversary’s slaves might have undergone at the
hands of the professional torturer, who, as an expert in such
matters, was empowered to assess the amount of depreciation
that they had sustained. It affords a curious commentary on
the high estimation in which such testimony was held to
observe that, when a man’s slaves had testified against him
on the rack, they were not protected from his subsequent
vengeance, which might be exercised upon them without
restriction.</p>

<p>As the laws of Greece passed away, leaving few traces on
the institutions of other races, save on those of Rome, it will
suffice to add that the principal modes in which torture was
sanctioned by them were the wheel, the ladder or rack, the
comb with sharp teeth, the low vault, in which the unfortunate
patient was thrust and bent double, the burning tiles, the
heavy hogskin whip, and the injection of vinegar into the
nostrils.<a id="FNanchor_1384_1384" href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a></p>

<p>In the earlier days of Rome, the general principles governing
the administration of torture were the same as in Greece.
Under the Republic, the free citizen was not liable to it, and
the evidence of slaves was not received without it. With the
progress of despotism, however, the safeguards which surrounded
the freeman were broken down, and autocratic emperors
had little scruple in sending their subjects to the rack.</p>

<p>Even as early as the second Triumvirate, a prætor named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
Q. Gallius, in saluting Octavius, chanced to have a double
tablet under his toga. To the timid imagination of the future
emperor, the angles of the tablet, outlined under the garment,
presented the semblance of a sword, and he fancied Gallius
to be the instrument of a conspiracy against his life. Dissembling
his fears for the moment, he soon caused the unlucky
prætor to be seized while presiding at his own tribunal, and,
after torturing him like a slave without extracting a confession,
put him to death.<a id="FNanchor_1385_1385" href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a></p>

<p>The incident was ominous of the future, when all the powers
of the state were concentrated in the august person of the
emperor. He was the representative and embodiment of the
limitless sovereignty of the people, whose irresponsible authority
was transferred to him. The rules and formularies which had
regulated the exercise of power, so long as it belonged to the
people, were feeble barriers to the passions and fears of Cæsarism.
Accordingly, a principle soon became engrafted in
Roman jurisprudence that, in all cases of <i>crimen majestatis</i>,
or high treason, the free citizen could be tortured. In striking
at the ruler he had forfeited all rights, and the safety of
the state, as embodied in the emperor, was to be preserved at
every sacrifice.</p>

<p>The emperors were not long in discovering and exercising
their power. When the plot of Sejanus was discovered, the
historian relates that Tiberius abandoned himself so entirely
to the task of examining by torture the suspected accomplices
of the conspiracy, that when an old Rhodian friend, who had
come to visit him on a special invitation, was announced to
him, the preoccupied tyrant absently ordered him to be placed
on the rack, and on discovering the blunder had him quietly
put to death, to silence all complaints. The shuddering inhabitants
pointed out a spot in Capri where he indulged in
these terrible pursuits, and where the miserable victims of his
wrath were cast into the sea before his eyes, after having ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>hausted
his ingenuity in exquisite torments.<a id="FNanchor_1386_1386" href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> When the
master of the world took this fearful delight in human agony,
it may readily be imagined that law and custom offered little
protection to the defenceless subject, and Tiberius was not
the only one who relished these inhuman pleasures. The
half-insane Caligula found that the torture of criminals by
the side of his dinner-table lent a keener zest to his revels,
and even the timid and the beastly Claudius made it a point
to be present on such occasions.<a id="FNanchor_1387_1387" href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a></p>

<p>Under the stimulus of such hideous appetites, capricious
and irresponsible cruelty was able to give a wide extension to
the law of treason. If victims were wanted to gratify the
whims of the monarch or the hate of his creatures, it was easy
to find an offender or to make a crime. Under Tiberius, a
citizen removed the head from a statue of Augustus, intending
to replace it with another. Interrogated before the Senate,
he prevaricated, and was promptly put to the torture. Encouraged
by this, the most fanciful interpretation was given to
violations of the respect assumed to be due to the late emperor.
To undress one’s self or to beat a slave near his image;
to carry into a latrine or a house of ill fame a coin or a ring
impressed with his sacred features; to criticize any act or word
of his became a treasonable offence; and finally an unlucky
wight was actually put to death for allowing the slaves on his
farm to pay him honors on the anniversary which had been
sacred to Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_1388_1388" href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a></p>

<p>So, when it suited the waning strength of paganism to wreak
its vengeance for anticipated defeat upon the rising energy of
Christianity, it was easy to include the new religion in the convenient
charge of treason, and to expose its votaries to all the
horrors of ingenious cruelty. If Nero desired to divert from
himself the odium of the conflagration of Rome, he could turn
upon the Christians, and by well-directed tortures obtain con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>fessions
involving the whole sect, thus giving to the populace
the diversion of a persecution on a scale until then unknown,
besides providing for himself the new sensation of the human
torches whose frightful agonies illuminated his unearthly
orgies.<a id="FNanchor_1389_1389" href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> Diocletian even formally promulgated in an edict
the rule that all professors of the hated religion should be
deprived of the privileges of birth and station, and be subject
to the application of torture.<a id="FNanchor_1390_1390" href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> The indiscriminate cruelty to
which the Christians were thus exposed without defence, at
the hands of those inflamed against them by all evil passions,
may, perhaps, have been exaggerated by the ecclesiastical historians,
but that frightful excesses were perpetrated under
sanction of law cannot be doubted by any one who has traced,
even in comparatively recent times and among Christian
nations, the progress of political and religious persecution.<a id="FNanchor_1391_1391" href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a></p>

<p>The torture of freemen accused of crimes against the state
or the sacred person of the emperor thus became an admitted
principle of Roman law. In his account of the conspiracy
of Piso, under Nero, Tacitus alludes to it as a matter of
course, and in describing the unexampled endurance of
Epicharis, a freedwoman, who underwent the most fearful
torments without compromising those who possessed little
claim upon her forbearance, the annalist indignantly compares
her fortitude with the cowardice of noble Romans, who be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>trayed
their nearest relatives and dearest friends at the mere
sight of the torture chamber.<a id="FNanchor_1392_1392" href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a></p>

<p>Under these limits, the freeman’s privilege of exemption
was carefully guarded, at least in theory. A slave while
claiming freedom, or a man claimed as a slave, could not be
exposed to torture;<a id="FNanchor_1393_1393" href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> and even if a slave, when about to be
tortured, endeavored to escape by asserting his freedom, it
was necessary to prove his servile condition before proceeding
with the legal torments.<a id="FNanchor_1394_1394" href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> In practice, however, these privileges
were continually infringed, and numerous edicts of the
emperors were directed to repressing the abuses which constantly
occurred. Thus we find Diocletian forbidding the
application of torture to soldiers or their children under accusation,
unless they had been dismissed the service ignominiously.<a id="FNanchor_1395_1395" href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a>
The same emperor published anew a rescript of
Marcus Aurelius declaring the exemption of patricians and of
the higher imperial officers, with their legitimate descendants
to the fourth generation;<a id="FNanchor_1396_1396" href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> and also a dictum of Ulpian
asserting the same privilege in favor of decurions, or local
town councillors, and their children.<a id="FNanchor_1397_1397" href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> In 376, Valentinian
was obliged to renew the declaration that decurions were only
liable in cases of <i>majestas</i>, and in 399 Arcadius and Honorius
found it necessary to declare explicitly that the privilege
was personal and not official, and that it remained to them
after laying down the decurionate.<a id="FNanchor_1398_1398" href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> Theodosius the Great, in
385, especially directed that priests should not be subjected
to torture in giving testimony,<a id="FNanchor_1399_1399" href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a> the significance of which is
shown by the fact that no slave could be admitted to holy
orders.</p>

<p>The necessity of this constant repetition of the law is indicated
by a rescript of Valentinian, in 369, which shows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
freemen were not infrequently tortured in contravention of
law; but that torture could legally be indiscriminately inflicted
by any tribunal in cases of treason, and that in other
accusations it could be authorized by the order of the emperor.<a id="FNanchor_1400_1400" href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a>
This power was early assumed and frequently exercised.
Though Claudius at the commencement of his reign
had sworn that he would never subject a freeman to the question,
yet he allowed Messalina and Narcissus to administer
torture indiscriminately, not only to free citizens, but even to
knights and patricians.<a id="FNanchor_1401_1401" href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> So Domitian tortured a man of
prætorian rank on a doubtful charge of intrigue with a vestal
virgin,<a id="FNanchor_1402_1402" href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a> and various laws were promulgated by several emperors
directing the employment of torture irrespective of
rank, in some classes of accusations. Thus, in 217, Caracalla
authorized it in cases of suspected poisoning by women.<a id="FNanchor_1403_1403" href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a>
Constantine decreed that unnatural lusts should be punished
by the severest torments, without regard to the station of the
offender.<a id="FNanchor_1404_1404" href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> Constantius persecuted in like manner soothsayers,
sorcerers, magicians, diviners, and augurs, who were
to be tortured for confession, and then to be put to death with
every refinement of suffering.<a id="FNanchor_1405_1405" href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> So, Justinian, under certain
circumstances, ordered torture to be used on parties accused
of adultery<a id="FNanchor_1406_1406" href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a>—a practice, however, which was already common
in the fourth century, if we are to believe the story related by
St. Jerome of a miracle occurring in a case of this nature.<a id="FNanchor_1407_1407" href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a>
The power thus assumed by the monarch could evidently be
limited only by his discretion in its exercise.</p>

<p>One important safeguard, however, existed, which, if properly
maintained, must have greatly lessened the frequency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
of torture as applied to freemen. In bringing an accusation
the accuser was obliged to inscribe himself formally, and was
exposed to the <i>lex talionis</i> in case he failed to prove the
justice of the charge.<a id="FNanchor_1408_1408" href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> A rescript of Constantine, in 314,
decrees that in cases of <i>majestas</i>, as the accused was liable
to the severity of torture without limitation of rank, so the
accuser and his informers were to be tortured when they were
unable to make good their accusation.<a id="FNanchor_1409_1409" href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> This enlightened
legislation was preserved by Justinian, and must have greatly
cooled the ardor of the pack of calumniators and informers,
who, from the days of Sylla, had been encouraged and
petted until they held in their hands the life of almost every
citizen.</p>

<p>In all this it must be borne in mind that the freeman of the
Roman law was a Roman citizen, and that, prior to the extension
of citizenship generally to the subjects of the Empire,
there was an enormous class deprived of the protection, such
as it was, of the traditional exemption. Thus when, in
Jerusalem, the Jews raised a tumult and accused St. Paul,
without specifying his offence, the tribune forthwith ordered
“that he should be examined by scourging, that he might
know wherefore they cried so against him;” and when St.
Paul proclaimed himself a Roman, the preparations for his
torture were stopped forthwith, and he was examined by
regular judicial process.<a id="FNanchor_1410_1410" href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a> The value of this privilege is fairly
exemplified by the envying remark of the tribune, “With a
great sum obtained I this freedom.”</p>

<p>All these laws relate to the extortion of confessions from
the accused. In turning to the treatment of witnesses, we
find that even with them torture was not confined to the servile
condition. With slaves it was not simply a consequence
of slavery, but a mode of confirming and rendering admissible
the testimony of those whose character was not sufficiently
known to give their evidence credibility without it. Thus a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
legist under Constantine states that gladiators and others of
similar occupation cannot be allowed to bear witness without
torture;<a id="FNanchor_1411_1411" href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> and, in the same spirit, a novel of Justinian, in 539,
directs that the rod shall be used to extract the truth from unknown
persons who are suspected of bearing false witness or
of being suborned.<a id="FNanchor_1412_1412" href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a></p>

<p>It may, therefore, readily be imagined that when the evidence
of slaves was required, it was necessarily accompanied
by the application of torture. Indeed, Augustus declared
that while it is not to be expressly desired in trifling matters,
yet in weighty and capital cases the torture of slaves is the
most efficacious mode of ascertaining the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1413_1413" href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> When we
consider the position occupied by slavery in the Roman
world, the immense proportion of bondmen who carried on
all manner of mechanical and industrial occupations for the
benefit of their owners, and who, as scribes, teachers, stewards,
and in other confidential positions, were privy to almost
every transaction of their masters, we can readily see that
scarce any suit could be decided without involving the testimony
of slaves, and thus requiring the application of torture.
It was not even, as among most modern nations, restricted to
criminal cases. Some doubt, indeed, seems at one time to
have existed as to its propriety in civil actions, but Antoninus
Pius decided the question authoritatively in the affirmative,
and this became a settled principle of Roman jurisprudence,
even when the slaves belonged to masters who were not party
to the case at issue.<a id="FNanchor_1414_1414" href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a></p>

<p>There was but one limitation to the universal liability of
slaves. They could not be tortured to extract testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
against their masters, whether in civil or criminal cases;<a id="FNanchor_1415_1415" href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a>
though, if a slave had been purchased by a litigant to get his
testimony out of court, the sale was pronounced void, the
price was refunded, and the slave could then be tortured.<a id="FNanchor_1416_1416" href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a>
This limitation arose from a careful regard for the safety of
the master, and not from any feeling of humanity towards the
slave. So great a respect, indeed, was paid to the relationship
between the master and his slave that the principle was
pushed to its fullest extent. Thus even an employer, who
was not the owner of a slave, was protected against the testimony
of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1417_1417" href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a> When a slave was held in common by
several owners, he could not be tortured in opposition to any
of them, unless one were accused of murdering his partner.<a id="FNanchor_1418_1418" href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a>
A slave could not be tortured in a prosecution against the
father or mother of the owner, or even against the guardian,
except in cases concerning the guardianship;<a id="FNanchor_1419_1419" href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> though the slave
of a husband could be tortured against the wife.<a id="FNanchor_1420_1420" href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> Even the tie
which bound the freedman to his patron was sufficient to preserve
the former from being tortured against the latter;<a id="FNanchor_1421_1421" href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> whence
we may assume that, in other cases, manumission afforded no
protection from the rack and scourge. This question, however,
appears doubtful. The exemption of freedmen would
seem to be proved by the rescript which provides that inconvenient
testimony should not be got rid of by manumitting
slaves so as to prevent their being subjected to torture;<a id="FNanchor_1422_1422" href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> while,
on the other hand, a decision of Diocletian directs that, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
cases of alleged fraudulent wills, the slaves and even the freedmen
of the heir could be tortured to ascertain the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1423_1423" href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a></p>

<p>This policy of the law in protecting masters from the evidence
of their tortured slaves varied at different periods.
From an expression of Tacitus, it would seem not to have
been part of the original jurisprudence of the Republic, but to
have arisen from a special decree of the Senate. In the early
days of the Empire, while the monarch still endeavored to
veil his irresponsible power under the forms of law, and
showed his reverence for ancient rights by evading them
rather than by boldly subverting them, Tiberius, in prosecuting
Libo and Silanus, caused their slaves to be transferred to
the public prosecutor, and was thus able to gratify his vengeance
legally by extorting the required evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1424_1424" href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> Subsequent
emperors were not reduced to these subterfuges, for
the principle became established that in cases of <i>majestas</i>,
even as the freeman was liable to torture, so his slaves could
be tortured to convict him;<a id="FNanchor_1425_1425" href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> and as if to show how utterly
superfluous was the cunning of Tiberius, the respect towards
the master in ordinary affairs was carried to that point that no
slave could be tortured against a former owner with regard to
matters which had occurred during his ownership.<a id="FNanchor_1426_1426" href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> On the
other hand, according to Ulpian, Trajan decided that when
the confession of a guilty slave under torture implicated his
master, the evidence could be used against the master, and
this, again, was revoked by subsequent constitutions.<a id="FNanchor_1427_1427" href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> Indeed,
it became a settled principle of law to reject all incriminations
of accomplices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span></p>

<p>Having thus broken down the protection of the citizen
against the evidence of his slaves in accusations of treason, it
was not difficult to extend the liability to other special crimes.
Accordingly we find that, in 197, Septimius Severus specified
adultery, fraudulent assessment, and crimes against the state
as cases in which the evidence of slaves against their masters
was admissible.<a id="FNanchor_1428_1428" href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> The provision respecting adultery was repeated
by Caracalla in 214, and afterwards by Maximus,<a id="FNanchor_1429_1429" href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> and
the same rule was also held to be good in cases of incest.<a id="FNanchor_1430_1430" href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> It
is probable that this increasing tendency alarmed the citizens
of Rome, and that they clamored for a restitution of their immunities,
for, when Tacitus was elected emperor, in 275, he
endeavored to propitiate public favor by proposing a law to
forbid the testimony of slaves against their masters except in
cases of <i>majestas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1431_1431" href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a> No trace of such a law, however, is
found in the imperial jurisprudence, and the collections of
Justinian show that the previous regulations were in full force
in the sixth century.</p>

<p>Yet it is probable that the progress of Christianity produced
some effect in mitigating the severity of legal procedure and
in shielding the unfortunate slave from the cruelties to which
he was exposed. Under the Republic, while the authority of
the <i>paterfamilias</i> was still unabridged, any one could offer his
slaves to the torture when he desired to produce their evidence.
In the earlier times, this was done by the owner himself
in the presence of the family, and the testimony thus
extorted was carefully taken down to be duly produced in
court; but subsequently the proceeding was conducted by
public officers—the quæstors and triumviri capitales.<a id="FNanchor_1432_1432" href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a> How
great was the change effected is seen by the declaration of
Diocletian, in 286, that masters were not permitted to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
forward their own slaves to be tortured for evidence in cases
wherein they were personally interested.<a id="FNanchor_1433_1433" href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> This would necessarily
reduce the production of slave testimony, save in accusations
of <i>majestas</i> and other excepted crimes, to cases in
which the slaves of third parties were desired as witnesses;
and even in these, the frequency of its employment must have
been greatly reduced by the rule which bound the party calling
for it to deposit in advance the price of the slave, as estimated
by the owner, to remunerate the latter for his death, or for his
diminished value if he were maimed or crippled for life.<a id="FNanchor_1434_1434" href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a>
When the slave himself was arraigned upon a false accusation
and tortured, an old law provided that the master should receive
double the loss or damage sustained;<a id="FNanchor_1435_1435" href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> and in 383,
Valentinian the Younger went so far as to decree that those
who accused slaves of capital crimes should inscribe themselves,
as in the case of freemen, and should be subjected to
the <i>lex talionis</i> if they failed to sustain the charge.<a id="FNanchor_1436_1436" href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> This
was an immense step towards equalizing the legal condition of
the bondman and his master. It was apparently in advance
of public opinion, for the law is not reproduced in the compilations
of Justinian, and probably soon was disregarded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were some general limitations imposed on the application
of torture, but they were hardly such as to prevent its
abuse at the hands of cruel or unscrupulous judges. Antoninus
Pius set an example, which modern jurists might well have
imitated, when he directed that no one should be tortured
after confession to implicate others;<a id="FNanchor_1437_1437" href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a> and a rescript of the
same enlightened emperor fixes at fourteen the minimum limit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
of age liable to torture, except in cases of <i>majestas</i>, when,
as we have seen, the law spared no one, for in the imperial
jurisprudence the safety of the monarch overrode all other
considerations.<a id="FNanchor_1438_1438" href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> Women were spared during pregnancy.<a id="FNanchor_1439_1439" href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>
Moderation was enjoined upon the judges, who were to inflict
only such torture as the occasion rendered necessary, and were
not to proceed further at the will of the accuser.<a id="FNanchor_1440_1440" href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> No one was
to be tortured without the inscription of a formal accuser, who
rendered himself liable to the <i>lex talionis</i>, unless there were
violent suspicions to justify it;<a id="FNanchor_1441_1441" href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> and Adrian reminded his
magistrates that it should be used for the investigation of truth,
and not for the infliction of punishment.<a id="FNanchor_1442_1442" href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> Adrian further
directed, in the same spirit, that the torture of slave witnesses
should only be resorted to when the accused was so nearly
convicted that it alone was required to confirm his guilt.<a id="FNanchor_1443_1443" href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a>
Diocletian ordered that proceedings should never be commenced
with torture, but that it might be employed when requisite
to complete the proof, if other evidence afforded rational
belief in the guilt of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1444_1444" href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a></p>

<p>What was the exact value set upon evidence procured by
torture it would be difficult at this day to determine. We
have seen above that Augustus pronounced it the best form
of proof, but other legislators and jurists thought differently.
Modestinus affirms that it is only to be believed when there
is no other mode of ascertaining the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1445_1445" href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> Adrian cautions
his judges not to trust to the torture of a single slave, but to
examine all cases by the light of reason and argument.<a id="FNanchor_1446_1446" href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> According
to Ulpian, the imperial constitutions provided that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
was not always to be received nor always rejected; in his own
opinion it was unsafe, dangerous, and deceptive, for some men
were so resolute that they would bear the extremity of torment
without yielding, while others were so timid that through fear
they would at once inculpate the innocent.<a id="FNanchor_1447_1447" href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> From the manner
in which Cicero alternately praises and discredits it, we can
safely assume that lawyers were in the habit of treating it, not
on any general principle, but according as it might affect their
client in any particular case; and Quintilian remarks that it
was frequently objected to on the ground that under it one
man’s constancy makes falsehood easy to him, while another’s
weakness renders falsehood necessary.<a id="FNanchor_1448_1448" href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> That these views were
shared by the public would appear from the often quoted
maxim of Publius Syrus—“Etiam innocentes cogit mentiri
dolor”—and from Valerius Maximus, who devotes his chapter
<i>De Quæstionibus</i> to three cases in which it was erroneously
either trusted or distrusted. A slave of M. Agrius was accused
of the murder of Alexander, a slave of C. Fannius. Agrius
tortured him, and, on his confessing the crime, handed him
over to Fannius, who put him to death. Shortly afterwards,
the missing slave returned home. This same Alexander was
made of sterner stuff, for when he was subsequently suspected
of being privy to the murder of C. Flavius, a Roman knight,
he was tortured six times and persistently denied his guilt,
though he subsequently confessed it and was duly crucified.<a id="FNanchor_1449_1449" href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a>
A somewhat similar case gave Apollonius of Tyana an opportunity
of displaying his supernatural power. Meeting in
Alexandria twelve convicts on their way to execution as robbers,
he pronounced one of them to be innocent, and asked
the executioners to reserve him to the last, and, moreover,
delayed them by his conversation. After eight had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
beheaded, a messenger came in hot haste to announce that
Phanion, the one selected by Apollonius, was innocent, though
he had accused himself to avoid the torture.<a id="FNanchor_1450_1450" href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> A curious instance,
moreover, of the little real weight attached to such
evidence is furnished by the case of Fulvius Flaccus, in which
the whole question turned upon the evidence of his slave
Philip. This man was actually tortured eight times, and refused
through it all to criminate his master, who was nevertheless
condemned.<a id="FNanchor_1451_1451" href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> The same conclusion is to be drawn
from the story told by St. Jerome of a woman of Vercelli repeatedly
tortured on an accusation of adultery, and finally
condemned to death in spite of her constancy in asserting her
innocence, the only evidence against her being that of her
presumed accomplice, extorted under torment.<a id="FNanchor_1452_1452" href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> Quintus
Curtius probably reflects the popular feeling on the subject, in
his pathetic narrative of the torture of Philotas on a charge of
conspiracy against Alexander. After enduring in silence the
extremity of hideous torment, he promised to confess if it
were stopped, and when the torturers were removed he addressed
his brother-in-law Craterus, who was conducting the
investigation: “Tell me what you wish me to say.” Curtius
adds that no one knew whether or not to believe his final confession,
for torture is as apt to bring forth lies as truth.<a id="FNanchor_1453_1453" href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a></p>

<p>From the instances given by Valerius Maximus, it may be
inferred that there was no limit set upon the application of
torture. The extent to which it might be carried appears to
have rested with the discretion of the tribunals, for, with the
exception of the general injunctions of moderation alluded to
above, no instructions for its administration are to be found
in the Roman laws which have been preserved to us, unless
it be the rule that when several persons were accused as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
accomplices, the judges were directed to commence with the
youngest and weakest.<a id="FNanchor_1454_1454" href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a></p>

<p>Since the time of Sigonius, much antiquarian research has
been directed to investigating the various forms of torture
employed by the Romans. They illustrate no principles, however,
and it is sufficient to enumerate the rack, the scourge,
fire in its various forms, and hooks for tearing the flesh, as
the modes generally authorized by law. The Christian historians,
in their narratives of the persecutions to which their
religion was exposed, give us a more extended idea of the resources
of the Roman torture chamber. Thus Prudentius, in
his description of the martyrdom of St. Vincent, alludes to a
number of varieties, among which we recognize some that became
widely used in after times, showing that little was left
for modern ingenuity to invent.<a id="FNanchor_1455_1455" href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a></p>

<p>I have dealt thus at length on the details of the Roman law
of torture because, as will be seen hereafter, it was the basis of
all modern legislation on the subject, and has left its impress
on the far less humane administration of criminal justice in
Europe almost to our own day. Yet at first it seemed destined
to disappear with the downfall of the Roman power.</p>

<small>THE BARBARIANS.</small></h3>


<p>In turning from the nicely poised and elaborate provisions
of the Imperial laws to the crude jurisprudence of the Barbarian
hordes who gradually inherited the crumbling remains of
the Empire of the West, we enter into social and political conditions
so different that we are naturally led to expect a cor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>responding
contrast in every detail of legislation. For the
cringing suppliant of the audience chamber, abjectly prostrating
himself before a monarch who combines in his own
person every legislative and executive function, we have the
freeman of the German forests, who sits in council with his
chief, who frames the laws which both are bound to respect,
and who pays to that chief only the amount of obedience
which superior vigor and intellect may be able to enforce.
The structure of such a society is fairly illustrated by the incident
which Gregory of Tours selects to prove the kingly
qualities of Clovis. During his conquest of Gaul, and before
his conversion, his wild followers pillaged the churches with
little ceremony. A bishop, whose cathedral had suffered
largely, sent to the king to request that a certain vase of unusual
size and beauty might be restored to him. Clovis could
only promise that if the messenger would accompany him to
Soissons, where the spoils were to be divided, and if the vase
should chance to fall to his share, it should be restored. When
the time came for allotting the plunder, he addressed his men,
requesting as a special favor that the vase might be given to
him before the division, but a sturdy soldier, brandishing his
axe, dashed it against the coveted article, exclaiming, “Thou
shalt take nothing but what the lot assigns to thee.” For a
year, Clovis dissembled his resentment at this rebuff, but at
length, when opportunity offered, he was prompt to gratify it.
While reviewing and inspecting his troops, he took occasion
to reproach bitterly the uncourtly Frank with the condition of
his weapons, which he pronounced unserviceable. The battle-axe
excited his especial displeasure. He threw it angrily to
the ground, and as the owner stooped to pick it up, Clovis
drove his own into the soldier’s head, with the remark, “It
was thus you served the vase at Soissons.”<a id="FNanchor_1456_1456" href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a></p>

<p>This personal independence of the freeman is one of the distinguishing
characteristics of all the primitive Teutonic institu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>tions.
Corporal punishments for him were unknown to the
laws. The principal resource for the repression of crime was
by giving free scope to the vengeance of the injured party,
and by providing fixed rates of composition by which he
could be bought off. As the criminal could defend himself
with the sword against the <i>faida</i> or feud of his adversary, or
could compound for his guilt with money, the suggestion of
torturing him to extort a confession would seem an absurd
violation of all his rights. Crimes were regarded solely as
injuries to individuals, and the idea that society at large was
interested in their discovery, punishment, and prevention, was
entirely too abstract to have any influence on the legislation of
so barbarous an age.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the codes of the Feini, the Ripuarians, the
Alamanni, the Angli and Werini, the Frisians, the Saxons,
and the Lombards contain no allusion to the employment of
torture under any circumstances; and such few directions for
its use as occur in the laws of the Salien Franks, of the Burgundians,
and of the Baioarians, do not conflict with the general
principle.</p>

<p>The personal inviolability which shielded the freeman cast
no protection over the slave. He was merely a piece of property,
and if he were suspected of a crime, the readiest and
speediest way to convict him was naturally adopted. His denial
could not be received as satisfactory, and the machinery
of sacramental purgation or the judicial duel was not for him.
If he were charged with a theft at home, his master would undoubtedly
tie him up and flog him until he confessed, and if
the offence were committed against a third party, the same
process would necessarily be adopted by the court. Barbarian
logic could arrive at no other mode of discovering and
repressing crime among the friendless and unprotected, whose
position seemed to absolve them from all moral responsibility.</p>

<p>The little that we know of the institutions of the ancient
Gauls presents us with an illustration of the same principle developed
in a somewhat different direction. Cæsar states that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
when a man of rank died, his relatives assembled and investigated
the circumstances of his death. If suspicion alighted
upon his wives, they were tortured like slaves, and if found
guilty they were executed with all the refinements of torment.<a id="FNanchor_1457_1457" href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a></p>

<p>In accordance with this tendency of legislation, therefore,
we find that among the Barbarians the legal regulations for
the torture of slaves are intended to protect the interests of
the owner alone. When a slave was accused of crime the
master, indeed, could not refuse to hand him over to the torturer,
unless he were willing to pay for him the full <i>wer-gild</i>
of a freeman, and if the slave confessed under the torture, the
master had no claim for compensation arising either from the
punishment or crippling of his bondman.<a id="FNanchor_1458_1458" href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> When, however,
the slave could not be forced to confess and was acquitted,
the owner had a claim for damages, though no compensation
was made to the unfortunate sufferer himself. The original
law of the Burgundians, promulgated in 471, is the earliest of
the Teutonic codes extant, and in that we find that the accuser
who failed to extract a confession was obliged to give to the
owner another slave, or to pay his value.<a id="FNanchor_1459_1459" href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a> The Baioarian law
is equally careful of the rights of ownership, but seems in addition
to attach some criminality to the excess of torture by
the further provision that, if the slave die under the torment
without confession, the prosecutor shall pay to the owner two
slaves of like value, and if unable to do so, that he shall himself
be delivered up as a slave.<a id="FNanchor_1460_1460" href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a> The Salic law, on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
hand, only guards the interests of the owner by limiting the
torture to 120 blows with a rod of the thickness of the little
finger. If this does not extort a confession, and the accuser
is still unsatisfied, he can deposit with the owner the value of
the slave, and then proceed to torture him at his own risk
and pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_1461_1461" href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that all these regulations provide merely
for extracting confessions from accused slaves, and not testimony
from witnesses. Indeed, the system of evidence adopted
by all the Barbarian laws for freemen was of so different a
character, that no thought seems to have been entertained of
procuring proof by the torture of witnesses. The only allusion,
indeed, to such a possibility shows how utterly repugnant
it was to the Barbarian modes of thought. In some MSS.
of the Salic law there occurs the incidental remark that when
a slave accused is under the torture, if his confession implicates
his master, the charge is not to be believed.<a id="FNanchor_1462_1462" href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a></p>

<p>Such was the primitive legislation of the Barbarians, but
though in principle it was long retained, in practice it was
speedily disregarded by those whom irresponsible power
elevated above the law. The Roman populations of the conquered
territories were universally allowed to live under their
old institutions; in fact, law everywhere was personal and not
territorial, every race and tribe, however intermingled on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
same soil, being subjected to its own system of jurisprudence.
The summary process of extracting confessions and testimony
which the Roman practice thus daily brought under the notice
of the Barbarians could not but be attractive to their violent
and untutored passions. Their political system was too loose
and undefined to maintain the freedom of the Sicambrian
forests in the wealthy plains of Gaul, and the monarch, who,
beyond the Rhine, had scarce been more than a military chief,
speedily became a despot, whose power over those immediately
around him was limited only by the fear of assassination, and
over his more distant subjects by the facility of revolution.</p>

<p>When all thus was violence, and the law of the strongest
was scarcely tempered by written codes, it is easy to imagine
that the personal inviolability of the freeman speedily ceased
to guarantee protection. Even amid the wild tribes which
remained free from the corruptions of civilization the idea of
torturing for confession the friendless and unprotected was
not unfamiliar, and in the Elder Edda we find King Geirröd
using the torment of fire for eight days on Odin, who visits
him in disguise for the purpose of testing his hospitality.<a id="FNanchor_1463_1463" href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a>
Among the Gallic Franks, therefore, it need not surprise us
to see irresponsible power readily grasping at such means to
gratify hate or ambition. In the long and deadly struggle
between Fredegonda and Brunhilda, for example, the fierce
passions of the adversaries led them to employ without scruple
the most cruel tortures in the endeavor to fathom each other’s
plots.<a id="FNanchor_1464_1464" href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a> A single case may be worth recounting to show how
completely torture had become a matter of course as the first
resource in the investigation of doubtful questions. When
Leudastes, about the year 580, desired to ruin the pious Bishop
Gregory of Tours, he accused him to Chilperic I. of slander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>ing
the fair fame of Queen Fredegonda, and suggested that
full proof for condemnation could be had by torturing Plato
and Gallienus, friends of the bishop. He evidently felt that
nothing further was required to substantiate the charge, nor
does Gregory himself, in narrating the affair, seem to think
that there was anything irregular in the proposition. Gallienus
and Plato were seized, but from some cause were discharged
unhurt. Then a certain Riculfus, an accomplice of Leudastes,
was reproached for his wickedness by a man named Modestus,
whereupon he accused Modestus to Fredegonda, who promptly
caused the unhappy wretch to be severely tortured without
extracting any information from him, and he was imprisoned
until released by the miraculous aid of St. Medard. Finally,
Gregory cleared himself canonically of the imputation, and
the tables were turned. Leudastes sought safety in flight.
Riculfus was not so fortunate. Gregory begged his life, but
could not save him from being tortured for confession. For
six hours the wretched man was hung up with his hands tied
behind his back, after which, stretched upon the rack, he was
beaten with clubs, rods, and thongs, by as many as could get
at him, until, as Gregory naïvely remarks, no piece of iron
could have borne it. At last, when nearly dead, his resolution
gave way, and he confessed the whole plot by which it
had been proposed to get rid of Chilperic and Fredegonda,
and to place Clovis on the throne.<a id="FNanchor_1465_1465" href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> Now, Plato, Gallienus,
and Modestus were probably of Gallo-Roman origin, but
Riculfus was evidently of Teutonic stock; moreover, he was a
priest, and Plato an archdeacon, and the whole transaction
shows that Roman law and Frankish law were of little avail
against the unbridled passions of the Merovingian.</p>

<small>THE GOTHS AND SPAIN.</small></h3>


<p>Of all the Barbarian tribes, none showed themselves so
amenable to the influences of Roman civilization as the Goths.
Their comparatively settled habits, their early conversion to
Christianity, and their position as allies of the empire long
before they became its conquerors, rendered them far less
savage under Alaric than were the Franks in the time of Clovis.
The permanent occupation of Septimania and Catalonia by
the Wisigoths, also, took place at a period when Rome was
not as yet utterly sunk, and when the power of her name
still possessed something of its ancient influence, which
could not but modify the institutions of the new-comers as
they strove to adapt their primitive customs to the altered
circumstances under which they found themselves. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, if their laws reflect a condition
of higher civilization than those of kindred races, and if the
Roman jurisprudence has left in them traces of the appreciation
of that wonderful work of the human intellect which the
Goths were sufficiently enlightened to entertain.</p>

<p>The Ostrogoths, allowing for the short duration of their
nationality, were even more exposed to the influences of Rome.
Their leader, Theodoric, had been educated in Constantinople,
and was fully as much a Roman as many of the Barbarian
soldiers who had risen to high station under the emperors, or
even to the throne itself. All his efforts were directed to harmonizing
the institutions of his different subjects, and he was
too sagacious not to see the manifest superiority of the Roman
polity.</p>

<p>His kingdom was too evanescent to consolidate and perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
its institutions or to accumulate any extended body of jurisprudence.
What little exists, however, manifests a compromise
between the spirit of the Barbarian tribes of the period
and that of the conquered mistress of the world. The Edict
of Theodoric does not allude to the torture of freemen, and
it is probable that the free Ostrogoth could not legally be subjected
to it. With respect to slaves, its provisions seem mainly
borrowed from the Roman law. No slave could be tortured
against a third party for evidence unless the informer or accuser
was prepared to indemnify the owner at his own valuation of
the slave. No slave could be tortured against his master, but
the purchase of a slave to render his testimony illegal was
pronounced null and void; the purchase money was returned,
and the slave was tortured. The immunity of freedmen is
likewise shown by the cancelling of any manumission conferred
for the purpose of preventing torture for evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1466_1466" href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a>
Theodoric, however, allowed his Roman subjects to be governed
by their ancient laws, and he apparently had no repugnance
to the use of torture when it could legally be inflicted.
Thus he seems particularly anxious to ferret out and punish
sorcerers, and in writing to the Prefect and Count of Rome
he urges them to apprehend certain suspected parties, and try
them by the regular legal process, which, as we have seen, by
the edicts of Constantius and his successors, was particularly
severe in enjoining torture in such cases, both as a means of
investigation and of punishment.<a id="FNanchor_1467_1467" href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Wisigoths founded a permanent
state, and as they were the only race whose use of torture was
uninterrupted from the period of their settlement until modern
times, and as their legislation on the subject was to a great extent
a model for that of other nations, it may be worth while
to examine it somewhat closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span></p>

<p>The earliest code of the Wisigoths is supposed to have been
compiled by Eurik, in the middle of the fifth century, but it
was subsequently much modified by recensions and additions.
It was remoulded by Chindaswind and Recaswind about the
middle of the seventh century, and it has reached us only in
this latest condition, while the MSS. vary so much in assigning
the authorship of the various laws that but little reliance
can be placed upon the assumed dates of most of them.
Chindaswind, moreover, in issuing his revised code, prohibited
for the future the use of the Roman law, which had
previously been in force among the subject populations, under
codes specially prepared for them by order of Alaric II.
Thus the Wisigothic laws, as we have them, are not laws of
race, like the other Barbarian codes, but territorial laws carefully
digested for a whole nation by men conversant alike with
the Roman and with their own ancestral jurisprudence.</p>

<p>It is therefore not surprising to find in them the use of
torture legalized somewhat after the fashion of the imperial
constitutions, and yet with some humane modifications and
restrictions. Slaves were liable to torture under accusation,
but the accuser had first to make oath that he was actuated by
neither fraud nor malice in preferring the charge; and he was
further obliged to give security that he would deliver to the
owner another slave of equal value if the accused were acquitted.
If an innocent slave were crippled in the torture,
the accuser was bound to give two of like value to the owner,
and the sufferer received his freedom. If the accused died
under the torture, the judge who had manifested so little feeling
and discretion in permitting it was also fined in a slave of like
value, making three enuring to the owner, and careful measures
were prescribed to insure that a proper valuation was made.
If the accuser was unable to meet the responsibility thus incurred,
he was himself forfeited as a slave. Moreover, the
owner was always at liberty to save his slave from the torture
by proving his innocence otherwise if possible; and if he suc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>ceeded,
the accuser forfeited to him a slave of equal value,
and was obliged to pay all the costs of the proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_1468_1468" href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a></p>

<p>Freedmen were even better protected. They could only be
tortured for crimes of which the penalties exceeded a certain
amount, varying with the nature of the freedom enjoyed by
the accused. If no confession were extorted, and the accused
were crippled in the torture, the judge and the accuser were
both heavily fined for his benefit, and if he died, the fines
were paid to his family.<a id="FNanchor_1469_1469" href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a></p>

<p>There could have been little torturing of slaves as witnesses,
for in general their evidence was not admissible, even under
torture, against any freeman, including their masters. The
slaves of the royal palace, however, could give testimony as
though they were freemen,<a id="FNanchor_1470_1470" href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> and, as in the Roman law, there
were certain excepted crimes, such as treason, adultery, homicide,
sorcery, and coining, in accusations of which slaves
could be tortured against their masters, nor could they be preserved
by manumission against this liability.<a id="FNanchor_1471_1471" href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a></p>

<p>As regards freemen, the provisions of different portions of
the code do not seem precisely in harmony, but all of them
throw considerable difficulties in the way of procedures by
torture. An early law directs that, in cases of theft or fraud,
no one shall be subjected to torture unless the accuser bring
forward the informer, or inscribe himself with three sureties
to undergo the <i>lex talionis</i> in case the accused prove innocent.
Moreover, if no confession were extorted, the informer
was to be produced. If the accuser could not do this, he was
bound to name him to the judge, who was then to seize him,
unless he were protected by some one too powerful for the
judicial authority to control. In this event it was the duty of
the judge to summon the authorities to his aid, and in default
of so doing he was liable for all the damages arising from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
case. The informer, when thus brought within control of the
court, was, if a freeman, declared infamous, and obliged to
pay ninefold the value of the matter in dispute; if a slave,
sixfold, and to receive a hundred lashes. If the freeman were
too poor to pay the fine, he was adjudged as a slave in common
to the accuser and the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1472_1472" href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a></p>

<p>A later law, issued by Chindaswind, is even more careful
in its very curious provisions. No accuser could force to the
torture a man higher in station or rank than himself. The
only cases in which it could be inflicted on nobles were those
of treason, homicide, and adultery, while for freemen of
humbler position the crime must be rated at a fine of 500
solidi at least. In these cases, an open trial was first prescribed.
If this were fruitless, the accuser who desired to
push the matter bound himself in case of failure to deliver
himself up as a slave to the accused, who could maltreat him
at pleasure, short of taking his life, or compound with him at
his own valuation of his sufferings. The torture then might
last for three days; the accuser himself was the torturer, subject
to the supervision of the judge, and might inflict torment
to any extent that his ingenuity could suggest, short of producing
permanent injury or death. If death resulted, the
accuser was delivered to the relatives of the deceased to be
likewise put to death; the judge who had permitted it through
collusion or corruption was exposed to the same fate, but if he
could swear that he had not been bribed by the accuser, he
was allowed to escape with a fine of 500 solidi. A very remarkable
regulation, moreover, provided against false confessions
extorted by torment. The accuser was obliged to
draw up his accusation in all its details, and submit it secretly
to the judge. Any confession under torture which did not
agree substantially with this was set aside, and neither convicted
the accused nor released the accuser from the penalties
to which he was liable.<a id="FNanchor_1473_1473" href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a></p>

<p>Under such a system, strictly enforced, few persons would
be found hardy enough to incur the dangers of subjecting an
adversary to the rack. As with the Franks, however, so
among the Wisigoths, the laws were not powerful enough to
secure their own observance. The authority of the kings
grew gradually weaker and less able to repress the assumptions
of ambitious prelates and unruly grandees, and it is easy to
imagine that in the continual struggle all parties sought to
maintain and strengthen their position by an habitual disregard
of law. At the Thirteenth Council of Toledo, in 683, King
Erwig, in his opening address, alludes to the frequent abuse
of torture in contravention of the law, and promises a reform.
The council, in turn, deplores the constantly recurring cases
of wrong and suffering wrought “regiæ subtilitatis astu vel
profanæ potestatis instinctu,” and proceeds to decree that in
future no freeman, noble, or priest shall be tortured unless
regularly accused or indicted, and properly tried in public;
and this decree duly received the royal confirmation.<a id="FNanchor_1474_1474" href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a></p>

<p>As the Goths emerge again into the light of history after the
Saracenic conquest, we find these ancient laws still in force
among the descendants of the refugees who had gathered
around Don Pelayo. The use of the Latin tongue gradually
faded out among them, and about the twelfth or thirteenth
century the Wisigothic code was translated into the popular
language, and this Romance version, known as the <i>Fuero
Juzgo</i>, long continued the source of law in the Peninsula. In
this, the provisions of the early Gothic monarchs respecting
torture are textually preserved, with two trifling exceptions,
which may reasonably be regarded as scarcely more than mere
errors of copyists.<a id="FNanchor_1475_1475" href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> Torture was thus maintained in Spain as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
an unbroken ancestral custom, and the earliest reference which
I have met with of it in mediæval jurisprudence occurs in 1228,
when Don Jayme el Conquistador of Aragon forbade his representatives
from commencing proceedings by its employment
without special orders.<a id="FNanchor_1476_1476" href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> When Alfonso the Wise, about the
middle of the thirteenth century, attempted to revise the jurisprudence
of his dominions, in the code known as <i>Las Siete
Partidas</i>, which he promulgated, he only simplified and
modified the proceedings, and did not remove the practice.
Although he proclaimed that the person of man is the noblest
thing of earth—“La persona del home es la mas noble cosa
del mundo”<a id="FNanchor_1477_1477" href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a>—he held that stripes and other torture inflicted
judicially were no dishonor even to Spanish sensitiveness.<a id="FNanchor_1478_1478" href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a>
Asserting that torture was frequently requisite for the discovery
of hidden crimes,<a id="FNanchor_1479_1479" href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> he found himself confronted by
the Church, which taught, as we shall see hereafter, that
confessions extorted under torture were invalid. To this
doctrine he gave his full assent,<a id="FNanchor_1480_1480" href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> and then, to reconcile these
apparently incompatible necessities, he adopted an expedient
partially suggested not long before by Frederic II., which
subsequently became almost universal throughout Europe,
whereby the prohibition of conviction on extorted confessions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
was eluded. After confession under torture, the prisoner was
remanded to his prison. On being subsequently brought before
the judge he was again interrogated, when, if he persisted
in his confession, he was condemned. If he recanted, he was
again tortured; and, if the crime was grave, the process could
be repeated a third time; but, throughout all, he could not be
convicted unless he made a free confession apart from the torture.
Even after conviction, moreover, if the judge found
reason to believe that the confession was the result of fear of
the torture, or of rage at being tortured, or of insanity, the
prisoner was entitled to an acquittal.<a id="FNanchor_1481_1481" href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> The humane interference
of the Church thus resulted only in a redoublement
of cruelty; and the system once introduced, speedily tended
to break down the limits imposed on it. In a little more than
half a century after the death of Alfonso, judges were in the
habit of not contenting themselves with three inflictions, but
continued the torture as long as the prisoner confessed on the
rack and retracted his confession subsequently.<a id="FNanchor_1482_1482" href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a></p>

<p>Alfonso’s admiration of the Roman law led him to borrow
much from it rather than from the Gothic code, though both
are represented in the provisions which he established. Thus,
except in accusations of treason, no one of noble blood could
be tortured, nor a doctor of laws or other learning, nor a
member of the king’s council, or that of any city or town, except
for official forgery, nor a pregnant woman, nor a child
under fourteen years of age.<a id="FNanchor_1483_1483" href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> So, when several accomplices
were on trial, the torturer was directed to commence with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
youngest and worst trained, as the truth might probably be
more readily extracted from him.<a id="FNanchor_1484_1484" href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> The provision, also, that
when a master, or mistress, or one of their children was found
dead at home, all the household slaves were liable to torture
in the search for the murderer, bears a strong resemblance to
the cruel law of the Romans, which condemned them to death
in case the murderer remained undiscovered.<a id="FNanchor_1485_1485" href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a></p>

<p>The regulations concerning the torture of slaves are founded,
with little variation, on the Roman laws. Thus, the evidence
of a slave was only admissible under torture, and no slave
could be tortured to prove the guilt of a present or former
owner, nor could a freedman, in a case concerning his patron,
subject to the usual exceptions which we have already seen.
The excepted crimes enumerated by Alfonso are seven, viz.:
adultery, embezzlement of the royal revenues by tax collectors,
high treason, murder of a husband or wife by the other, murder
of a joint owner of a slave by his partner, murder of a testator
by a legatee, and coining. With the slave, as with the freeman,
all testimony under torture required subsequent confirmation.<a id="FNanchor_1486_1486" href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a></p>

<p>There is one noteworthy innovation, however, in the Partidas
which was subsequently introduced widely into the torture
codes of Europe, and which, in theory at least, greatly
extended their sphere of action. This was the liability of
freemen as witnesses. When a man’s evidence was vacillating
and contradictory, so as to afford reasonable suspicion that he
was committing perjury, all criminal judges were empowered
to subject him to torture, so as to ascertain the truth, provided
always that he was of low condition, and did not belong to the
excepted classes.<a id="FNanchor_1487_1487" href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a></p>

<p>With all this, there are indications that Alfonso designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
rather to restrict than to extend the use of torture, and, if his
general instructions could have been enforced, there must have
been little occasion for its employment under his code. In
one passage he directs that when the evidence is insufficient
to prove a charge, the accused, if of good character, must be
acquitted; and in another he orders its application only when
common report is adverse to a prisoner, and he is shown to be
a man of bad repute.<a id="FNanchor_1488_1488" href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> Besides, an accuser who failed to prove
his charge was always liable to the <i>lex talionis</i>, unless he were
prosecuting for an offence committed on his own person, or
for the murder of a relative not more distant than a brother
or sister’s child.<a id="FNanchor_1489_1489" href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> The judge, moreover, was strictly enjoined
not to exceed the strict rules of the law, nor to carry the torture
to a point imperilling life or limb. If he deviated from
these limits, or acted through malice or favoritism, he was
liable to a similar infliction on his own person, or to a penalty
greater than if he were a private individual.<a id="FNanchor_1490_1490" href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> The liability
of witnesses was further circumscribed by the fact that in cases
involving corporal punishment, no one could be forced to bear
testimony who was related to either of the parties as far as the
fourth degree of consanguinity, in either the direct or collateral
lines, nor even when nearly connected by marriage, as in the
case of fathers-in-law, step-children, etc.<a id="FNanchor_1491_1491" href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> Orders to inflict
torture, moreover, were one of the few procedures which could
be appealed from in advance.<a id="FNanchor_1492_1492" href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> Several of these limitations became
generally adopted through Europe. We shall see, however,
that they afforded little real protection to the accused,
and it is more than probable that they received as little respect
in Spain as elsewhere.</p>

<p>There were many varieties of torture in use at the period,
but Alfonso informs us that only two were commonly employed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
the scourge and the strappado, which consisted in hanging
the prisoner by the arms while his back and legs were loaded
with heavy weights.<a id="FNanchor_1493_1493" href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> The former of these, however, seems to
be the only one alluded to throughout the code.</p>

<p>As a whole, the Partidas were too elaborate and too much
in advance of the wants of the age to be immediately successful
as a work of legislation, and they were not confirmed by
the Córtes until 1348. In the Ordenamiento de Alcalà of
Alfonso XI., issued in-that year, they are referred to as supplying
all omissions in subsequent codes.<a id="FNanchor_1494_1494" href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a></p>

<p>It is probable that in his system of torture Alfonso the
Wise merely regulated and put into shape the customs prevalent
in his territories, for the changes in it which occurred
during the succeeding three or four centuries are merely such
as can be readily explained by the increasing influence of the
revived Roman jurisprudence, and the introduction of the
doctrines of the Inquisition with respect to criminal procedures.
In the final shape which the administration of torture
assumed in Castile, as described by Villadiego, an eminent
legist writing about the year 1600, it was only employed when
the proof was strong, and yet not sufficient for conviction.
No allusion is made to the torture of witnesses, and Villadiego
condemns the cruelty of some judges who divide the torture
into three days in order to render it more effective, since,
after a certain prolongation of torment, the limbs begin to
lose their sensibility, which is recovered after an interval, and
on the second and third days they are more sensitive than at first.
This he pronounces rather a repetition than a continuation of
torture, and repetition was illegal unless rendered necessary
by the introduction of new testimony.<a id="FNanchor_1495_1495" href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a> As in the thirteenth
century, nobles, doctors of law, pregnant women, and children
under fourteen were not liable, except in cases of high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
treason and some other heinous offences. The clergy also were
now exempted, unless previously condemned as infamous, and
advocates engaged in pleading enjoyed a similar privilege.
With the growth of the Inquisition, however, heresy had now
advanced to the dignity of a crime which extinguished all prerogatives,
for it was held to be a far more serious offence to
be false to Divine than to human majesty.<a id="FNanchor_1496_1496" href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> The Partidas
allow torture in the investigation of comparatively trivial
offences, but Villadiego states that it should be employed only
in the case of serious crimes, entailing bodily punishment
more severe than the torture itself, and torture was worse than
the loss of the hands. Thus, when only banishment, fines, or
imprisonment were involved, it could not be used. The
penalties incurred by judges for its excessive or improper application
were almost identical with those prescribed by Alfonso,
and the limitation that it should not be allowed to
endanger life or limb was only to be exceeded in the case of
treason, when the utmost severity was permissible.<a id="FNanchor_1497_1497" href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> In 1489
Ferdinand and Isabella had directed that no criminal case
should be heard by less than three alcaldes or judges sitting
together, and torture could not be employed without a formal
decision signed unanimously by all three. In 1534 Charles
V. called attention to the neglect of this rule, whereby the accused
was deprived of the right of appeal, and he ordered
that it should be strictly observed in future—regulations which
duly maintained their place on the statute book as long as the
use of torture was continued.<a id="FNanchor_1498_1498" href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a></p>

<p>Many varieties were in use, but the most common were the
strappado and pouring water down the throat; but when the
accused was so weak as to render these dangerous, fire was
applied to the soles of the feet; and the use of the scourge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
was not unusual. As in the ancient laws, the owner of slaves
was entitled to compensation when his bondmen were unjustly
tortured. If there was no justification for it, he was reimbursed
in double the estimated value; if the judge exceeded
the proper measure of torment, he made it good to the owner
with another slave.<a id="FNanchor_1499_1499" href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a></p>

<p>Whatever limitations may theoretically have been assigned
to the application of torture, however, it is probable that they
received little respect in practice. Simancas, Bishop of Badajos,
who was a little anterior to Villadiego, speaks of it as
a generally received axiom that scarcely any criminal accusation
could be satisfactorily tried without torture.<a id="FNanchor_1500_1500" href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> This is
confirmed by the account recently discovered by Bergenroth
of the secret history of the execution of Don Carlos, for,
whether it be authentic or not, it shows how thoroughly the
use of torture had interpenetrated the judicial system of Spain.
It states that when Philip II. determined to try his wretched
son for the crime of encouraging the rebellious movements in
the Netherlands, and the prince denied the offence, torture
was applied until he fainted, and, on recovering his senses,
consented to confess in order to escape the repetition which
was about to be applied. It is hardly to be believed that even
a Spanish imagination could invent the dark and terrible details
of this dismal story; and even if it be not true, its author
must have felt that such an incident was too probable to
destroy its vraisemblance.</p>

<p>At the same time, Castilian justice kept itself free from one
of the worst abuses which, as we shall see hereafter, grew out
of the use of torture, in the secret inquisitorial process which
established itself almost everywhere. A law of Alfonso XI.
issued in 1325 peremptorily ordered that the accused should
not be denied the right to know the contents of the inquest
made with respect to him, and that the names of the witnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
should be communicated to him so that he could defend himself
freely and have all the means to which he was entitled of
establishing his innocence. Ferdinand and Isabella, moreover,
in 1480, decreed that all who desired counsel should be
allowed the privilege, those who were poor being furnished at
the public expense, and no torture could be inflicted before
this was complied with. These laws, which offer so creditable
a contrast to the legislation of other lands, remained in force
and were embodied in the Recopilacion.<a id="FNanchor_1501_1501" href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a></p>

<small>CARLOVINGIAN AND FEUDAL LAW.</small></h3>


<p>In turning to the other barbarian races which inherited the
fragments of the Roman empire, we find that the introduction
of torture as a recognized and legal mode of investigation was
long delayed. Under the Merovingians, as we have seen, its
employment, though not infrequent, was exceptional and without
warrant of law. When the slow reconstruction of society
at length began, the first faint trace of torture is to be found
in a provision respecting the crimes of sorcery and magic.
These were looked upon with peculiar detestation, as offences
against both God and man. It is no wonder then if the safeguards
which the freeman enjoyed under the ordinary modes
of judicial procedure were disregarded in the cases of those
who violated every law, human and divine. The legislation
of Charlemagne, indeed, was by no means merciful in its
general character. His mission was to civilize, if possible, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
savage and turbulent races composing his empire, and he was
not overnice in the methods selected to accomplish the task.
Still, he did not venture, even if he desired, to prescribe torture
as a means of investigation, except in the case of suspected
sorcerers, for whom, moreover, it is ordered indirectly
rather than openly.<a id="FNanchor_1502_1502" href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> Yet, by this time, the personal inviolability
of the freeman was gone. The infliction of stripes and
of hideous mutilations is frequently directed in the Capitularies,
and even torture and banishment for life are prescribed
as a punishment for insulting bishops and priests in church.<a id="FNanchor_1503_1503" href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a></p>

<p>This apparent inconsistency is only a repetition of what we
have seen in the Persian and Indian institutions, where torture
was superfluous in the presence of other forms of proof,
and in Greece and Rome where it makes its appearance in the
absence of those forms. Though there was no theoretical
objection to torture as a process of investigation, yet there was
no necessity for its employment as a means of evidence. That
the idea of thus using it in matters of great moment was not
unfamiliar to the men of that age is evident when we find it
officially stated that the accomplices of Bernard, King of Italy,
in his rebellion against Louis le Débonnaire, in 817, on their
capture confessed the whole plot without being put to the torture.<a id="FNanchor_1504_1504" href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a>
Such instances, however, were purely exceptional. In
ordinary matters, there was a complete system of attack and
defence which supplemented all deficiencies of testimony in
doubtful cases. Sacramental purgation, the wager of battle,
and the various forms of vulgar ordeals were not only primæval
customs suited to the feelings and modes of thought of the
race, but they were also much more in harmony with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
credulous faith inculcated by the Church, and the Church had
by this time entered on the career of temporal supremacy
which gave it so potent a voice in fashioning the institutions of
European society. For all these, the ministrations of the ecclesiastic
were requisite, and in many of them his unseen agency
might prove decisive. On the other hand, the humane precepts
which forbade the churchman from intervening in any manner
in judgments involving blood precluded his interference with
the torture chamber; and in fact, while torture was yet frequent
under the Merovingians, the canons of various councils
prohibited the presence of any ecclesiastic in places where
it was administered.<a id="FNanchor_1505_1505" href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a> Every consideration, therefore, would
lead the Church in the ninth century to prefer the milder forms
of investigation, and to use its all-powerful influence in maintaining
the popular belief in them. The time had not yet
come when, as we shall see hereafter, the Church, as the
spiritual head of feudal Christendom, would find the ordeal
unnecessary and torture the most practicable instrumentality
to preserve the purity of faith and the steadfastness of implicit
obedience.</p>

<p>In the ninth century, moreover, torture was incompatible
with the forms of judicial procedure handed down as relics
of the time when every freeman bore his share in the public
business of his sept. Criminal proceedings as yet were open
and public. The secret inquisitions which afterwards became
so favorite a system with lawyers did not then exist. The
<i>mallum</i>, or court, was perhaps no longer held in the open air,<a id="FNanchor_1506_1506" href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
nor were the freemen of the district constrained as of old to
be present,<a id="FNanchor_1507_1507" href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> but it was still free to every one. The accuser
and his witnesses were confronted with the accused, and the
criminal must be present when his sentence was pronounced.<a id="FNanchor_1508_1508" href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a>
The purgatorial oath was administered at the altar of the
parish church; the ordeal was a public spectacle; and the
judicial duel drew thousands of witnesses as eager for the
sight of blood as the Roman plebs. These were all ancestral
customs, inspiring implicit reverence, and forming part of the
public life of the community. To substitute for them the
gloomy dungeon through whose walls no echo of the victim’s
screams could filter, where impassible judges coldly compared
the incoherent confession wrung out by insufferable torment
with the anonymous accusation or the depositions of secret witnesses,
required a total change in the constitution of society.</p>

<p>The change was long in coming. Feudalism arose and
consolidated its forces on the ruins of the Carlovingian empire
without altering the principles upon which the earlier
procedures of criminal jurisdiction had been based. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
local dignitaries seized upon their fiefs and made them hereditary,
so they arrogated to themselves the dispensation of
justice which had formerly belonged to the central power, but
their courts were still open to all. Trials were conducted in
public upon well-known rules of local law and custom; the
fullest opportunities were given for the defence; and a denial
of justice authorized the vassal to renounce the jurisdiction of
his feudal lord and seek a superior court.<a id="FNanchor_1509_1509" href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a></p>

<p>Still, as under the Merovingians, torture, though unrecognized
by law, was occasionally employed as an extraordinary
element of judicial investigation, as well as a means of punishment
to gratify the vengeance of the irresponsible and cruel
tyrants who ruled with absolute sway over their petty lordships.
A few such instances occur in the documents and
chronicles of the period, but the terms in which they are
alluded to show that they were regarded as irregular.</p>

<p>Thus, it is related of Wenceslas, Duke of Bohemia, in the
early part of the tenth century, that he destroyed the gibbets
and fearful instruments of torture wherewith the cruelty of
his judges had been exercised, and that he never allowed
them to be restored.<a id="FNanchor_1510_1510" href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> An individual case of torture which
occurred in 1017 has chanced to be preserved to us by its
ending in a miracle, and being the occasion of the canonization
of a saint. A pious pilgrim, reputed to belong to the
royal blood of Scotland, while wandering on the marches
between the Bavarians and the Moravians, was seized by the
inhabitants on suspicion of being a spy, and, to extort a confession,
was exposed to a succession of torments which ended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
in hanging him on a withered tree until he died. The falsity
of the accusation and the sanctity of the victim were manifested
by the uninterrupted growth of his hair and nails and
the constant flowing of blood from a wound, while the dead
tree suddenly put forth leaves and flowers. Margrave Henry
of Bavaria had him reverently buried, and he was duly enrolled
in the catalogue of saints.<a id="FNanchor_1511_1511" href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> A letter of Gerard, Bishop
of Cambrai, in 1025, relating how certain suspected heretics
could not be forced by torment to confession, shows that
ecclesiastics already were prepared, in spite of the received
dogmas of the Church, to have recourse to such means when
no others could be found to protect the purity of the faith.<a id="FNanchor_1512_1512" href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a>
In the celebrated case, also, of the robbery of the church of
Laon, about the year 1100, the suspected thief, after conviction
by the cold water ordeal, was tortured by command of
the bishop in order to make him surrender the sacred vessels
which he had concealed. Basting with hot lard was tried unsuccessfully;
he was then hanged by the neck and let down
at intervals for nearly a whole day, and when life was almost
extinct his resolution gave way and he agreed to discover the
place where the valuables were hidden.<a id="FNanchor_1513_1513" href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> When Charles the
Good of Flanders was murdered in 1127, one of the assassins

1130 at Petersberg, in Saxony, we are told of a shepherd
tortured by his lord to extract money, and saved from suffering
by an earnest prayer to St. Peter.<a id="FNanchor_1515_1515" href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> When Richard I. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
England was endeavoring to return through Germany from
the crusade, it was by the torture of his page that the identity
of the royal traveller was discovered, and he was delivered
to his enemy the Duke of Austria.<a id="FNanchor_1516_1516" href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a></p>

<p>These are evidently rather sporadic and exceptional cases
than indications of any systematic introduction of the practice.
A more significant allusion, however, is found in the reproof
administered, about 1125, by Hildebert, Bishop of le Mans,
to one of his priests, who had been concerned in the torture
of a suspected thief, for the purpose of extracting a confession.
Hildebert argues that the infliction of torture for confession is
a matter for judicial decision and not of Church discipline,
and therefore not fit for a clerk to be engaged in.<a id="FNanchor_1517_1517" href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> This would
seem to show that it occasionally was a recognized means of
proof in the lay tribunals of the period, though as yet not
favored by the Church. If so, no record of its introduction
or evidence of its customary use has been preserved to us,
though there is abundant evidence of its employment as a
punishment and for the extortion of money.</p>

<p>As a punishment legally inflicted, we find it prescribed, in
1168, by Frederic Barbarossa in cases of petty thefts,<a id="FNanchor_1518_1518" href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> and in
the next century by Frederic II. as a penalty for high treason.<a id="FNanchor_1519_1519" href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a>
Special cases, too, may be instanced, where its infliction on a
large scale shows that the minds of men were not unfamiliar
with its use. Thus when, in 1125, the inhabitants of Erfurt
were guilty of some outrages on the imperial authority, and
the town was besieged and captured by the Emperor Lothair,
the chronicler relates that large numbers of the citizens were
either killed, blinded, or tortured in various ways by the vindictive
conqueror,<a id="FNanchor_1520_1520" href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> and in 1129 he treated the citizens of
Halle in the same manner.<a id="FNanchor_1521_1521" href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span></p>

<p>Even towards the close of the thirteenth century, we find
Rodolph of Hapsburg interfering in favor of a prisoner whom
one of his nobles was afflicting with cruel torments. The
Emperor, however, does not venture to command, but merely
entreats that the tortures be suspended until he shall have an
interview with the aggressor.<a id="FNanchor_1522_1522" href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a></p>

<p>So summary and effective a mode of forcing the weak and
unprotected to ransom themselves was not likely to be overlooked
in those ages of violence, and though the extra-judicial
use of torture is foreign to our purpose, yet, as showing how men
educated themselves in its employment, it may be worth while
to allude briefly to this aspect of the subject. Thus, Duke
Swantopluck of Bohemia, in a marauding expedition into
Hungary in 1108, caused to be racked or put to death all
prisoners who could not purchase escape by heavy ransoms.<a id="FNanchor_1523_1523" href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a>
At the same period, Germany is described to us by an eye-witness
as covered with feudal chieftains who lived a life of
luxury by torturing the miserable wretches that could scarce
obtain bread and water for their own existence.<a id="FNanchor_1524_1524" href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> In Spain,
the same means were understood and employed by the savage
nobles of that barbarous period.<a id="FNanchor_1525_1525" href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> In England, the fearful
anarchy which prevailed under King Stephen encouraged a
similar condition of affairs. The baronial castles which then
multiplied so rapidly became mere dens of robbers who ransacked
the country for all who had the unfortunate reputation
of wealth. From these they extracted the last penny by
tortures; and the chronicler expatiates on the multiplicity and
horrid ingenuity of the torments devised—suspension by the
feet over slow fires; hanging by the thumbs; knotted ropes
twisted around the head; crucet-houses, or chests filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
sharp stones, in which the victim was crushed; sachentages,
or frames with a sharp iron collar preventing the wearer from
sitting, lying, or sleeping; dungeons filled with toads and
adders; slow starvation, &amp;c. &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_1526_1526" href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> Even in the more settled
times of the close of the reign of Henry II. a case is recorded
of a heavy fine inflicted on a man for illegally capturing and
torturing a woman;<a id="FNanchor_1527_1527" href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> under Richard I. an epistle of Clement
III. refers to a knight who had confessed that he had tortured
a priest and forced him to redeem himself with a large sum of
money;<a id="FNanchor_1528_1528" href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> and in 1210 King John seized all the Jews in England
and tortured them until they ransomed themselves
heavily.<a id="FNanchor_1529_1529" href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a></p>

<p>In all this, however, there is no evidence of the revival of
torture as a means of legal investigation. The community
was satisfied with the old barbaric forms of trial, and the
Church, still true to its humanizing instincts, lost no opportunity
of placing the seal of its disapprobation on the whole
theory of extorting confessions. At an early period, it had
even been a matter of dispute whether a Christian magistrate,
after baptism, was at liberty to inflict torment and pronounce
sentence of death. The Synod of Rome in 384 had declared
that no Christian could exercise secular power without sin,
because he was obliged to contravene the teachings of the
Church by ordering the application of torture in judicial
pleadings;<a id="FNanchor_1530_1530" href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> and if Innocent I., in 405, had decided that such
proceedings were lawful, it was only on the ground that the
Church had no right to resist the laws or to oppose the powers
ordained of God.<a id="FNanchor_1531_1531" href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> About the same time St. Augustin had
exposed the cruel absurdity of torture with a cogent terseness
that has rarely been excelled, and had stamped it with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
infamy which it deserved.<a id="FNanchor_1532_1532" href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> The great name of Gregory I.
was on record in the sixth century, denouncing as worthless a
confession extorted by incarceration and hunger.<a id="FNanchor_1533_1533" href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a> When
Nicholas I., who did so much to build up ecclesiastical power
and influence, addressed, in 866, his well-known epistle to the
Bulgarians to aid and direct them in their conversion to orthodoxy,
he recites that he is told that, in cases of suspected
theft, their courts endeavor to extort confession by stripes, and
by pricking with a pointed iron. This he pronounces to be
contrary to all law, human and divine, for confessions to be
valid should be spontaneous; and he argues at some length on
the uncertainty of the system of torture, and the injustice to
which it leads, concluding with a peremptory prohibition of
its continuance.<a id="FNanchor_1534_1534" href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a></p>

<p>In the first half of the same century, the manufacturers of
the False Decretals had attributed to Alexander I. an epistle
designed to protect the Church from pillage and oppression,
in which that pontiff is made to threaten with infamy and
excommunication those who extort confessions or other writings
from ecclesiastics by force or fear, and to lay down the
general rule that confessions must be voluntary and not compulsory.<a id="FNanchor_1535_1535" href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a>
On the authority of this, Ivo of Chartres, at the
commencement of the twelfth century, declares that men in
holy orders cannot be forced to confess;<a id="FNanchor_1536_1536" href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> and half a century
later, Gratian lays down the more general as well as more
explicit rule that no confession is to be extorted by the instrumentality
of torture.<a id="FNanchor_1537_1537" href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a> This position was consistently maintained
until the revival of the Roman law familiarized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
minds of men with the procedures of the imperial jurisprudence,
when the policy of the Church altered, and it yielded
to the temptation of obtaining so useful a means of reaching
and proving the otherwise impalpable crime of heresy.</p>

<small>REAPPEARANCE OF TORTURE.</small></h3>


<p>The latter half of the twelfth century saw the study of the
civil law prosecuted with intense ardor, and, in the beginning
of the thirteenth, Innocent III. struck a fatal blow at the
barbaric systems of the ordeal and sacramental compurgation
by forbidding the rites of the Church to the one and altering
the form of oath customary to the other. The unreasoning
faith which had reposed confidence in the boiling caldron, or
the burning ploughshare, or the trained champion as the
special vehicle of Divine judgment, was fading before the
Aristotelian logic of the schools, and dialectical skill could
not but note the absurdity of acquitting a culprit because he
could beg or buy two, or five, or eleven men to swear to their
belief in his oath or denial.</p>

<p>Yet with all these influences at work, the ancestral customs
maintained their ground long and stubbornly. It is not until
the latter half of the thirteenth century that the first faint
traces of legalized torture are to be found in France, at whose
University of Paris for more than a hundred years the study
of the Pandects had become the absorbing topic, and where
the constantly increasing power of the crown found its most
valuable instruments in the civil lawyers, and its surest weapon
against feudalism in the extension of the royal jurisdiction.
In Germany, the progress was even slower. The decline of
the central authority, after the death of Frederic Barbarossa,
rendered any general change impossible, and made the absolutist
principles of the imperial jurisprudence especially dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>tasteful
to the crowd of feudal sovereigns, whose privileges
were best supported by perpetuating organized anarchy. The
early codes, therefore, the Sachsenspiegel, the Schwabenspiegel,
the Kayser-Recht, and the Richstich Landrecht, which embodied
the judicial proceedings of the Teutonic nations from the
thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, seem to know no other
mode of deciding doubtful questions than sacramental purgation
and the various forms of ordeal. During the latter portion
of this period, it is true, torture begins to appear, but it
is an innovation.<a id="FNanchor_1538_1538" href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a></p>

<p>The first indications of the modern use of torture show distinctly
that its origin is derived from the civil law. In the
Latin Kingdoms of the East, the Teutonic races were brought
into contact with the remains of the old civilization, impressive
even in its decrepitude. It was natural that, in governing
the motley collection of Greeks, Syrians, and Franks, for
whom they had to legislate, they should adopt some of the institutions
which they found in force amid their new possessions,
and it is only surprising that torture did not form a more
prominent feature in their code. The earliest extant text of the
<i>Assises de Jerusalem</i> is not older than the thirteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
and the blundering and hesitating way in which it recognizes,
in a single instance, the use of torture shows how novel was
the idea of such procedure to the feudal barons, and how
little they understood the principles governing its application.
When a murderer was caught in the act by two witnesses, he
could be promptly hanged on their testimony, if they were
strangers to the victim. If, however, they were relatives,
their testimony was held suspect, and the confession of the
accused was requisite to his conviction. To obtain this, he
was subjected to torture for three days; if he confessed, he
was hanged; if obdurate, he was imprisoned for a year and a
day, with the privilege of clearing himself during that period
by the ordeal of the red-hot iron. If he declined this, and if
during his confinement no additional evidence was procured,
he was acquitted, and could not be again appealed for the
murder.<a id="FNanchor_1539_1539" href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a></p>

<p>This show’s the transition state of the question. The
criminal is caught with the red hand and the evidence of guilt
is complete, save that the witnesses may be interested; confession
thus becomes requisite, yet the failure to extort it by
prolonged torment does not clear the accused; the ordeal is
resorted to in order to supplement the torture, and solve the
doubts which the latter could not remove; and finally, the
criminal is absolved, though he dare not trust the judgment of
God, and though the uncertainties in which torture had left
the case are not removed.</p>

<p>Italy was the centre from which radiated the influences of
the Roman law throughout Western Europe, and, as might be
expected, it is to Italy that we must look for the earliest incorporation
of torture in the procedures of modern criminal
jurisprudence. The Veronese laws in force in 1228 already
show a mixture of proceedings suggestive, like the Assises de
Jerusalem, of the impending change. In doubtful cases, the
podestà was empowered to ascertain the truth of testimony by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
either inquest, torture, or the duel.<a id="FNanchor_1540_1540" href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> This shows that the
employment of torture was by this time recognized to some
extent, though as the code is a very full one and this is the
only allusion to it, it evidently had not yet grown into one of
the regular legal processes. So in the legislation of Frederic
II. for his Neapolitan provinces, promulgated in 1231, the
mode in which it is prescribed shows that it was as yet but
sparingly employed. As Frederic was one of the earliest
secular legislators who discountenanced and restricted the
various forms of the ordeal, it was natural that, with his
education and temperament, he should seek to replace them
with the system of the Roman codes which he so much
admired.</p>

<p>When a secret murder or other heinous crime was committed,
and the most stringent investigation could not convict
the perpetrators, if the weight of suspicion fell on persons of
humble station and little consequence, they could be tortured
for confession. If no torment could wring from them an
acknowledgment of guilt, or if, as often happened (“prout
accidere novimus in plerisque”), their resolution gave way
under insufferable torment and they subsequently recanted,
then the punishment, in the shape of a fine, was inflicted on
the district where the crime had occurred.<a id="FNanchor_1541_1541" href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> From this it is
evident that torture was not exactly a novelty, but that as yet
it was only ventured upon with the lowest and most unprotected
class of society, and that confession during its infliction
was not regarded as sufficient for conviction, unless subsequently
ratified.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the century, the statutes of many
of the Italian cities show the gradual introduction of torture
to replace the barbarian processes which were not indigenous,<a id="FNanchor_1542_1542" href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a>
and which the traditional hate of the Italian States for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
the Tedeschi was not likely to render popular. That by the
middle of the century, indeed, the practical applications of
torture had been profoundly studied and were thoroughly understood
in all their most inhuman ramifications is sufficiently
evident from the accounts which we possess of the fearful
cruelties habitually practised by petty despots such as Eccelino
da Romano.<a id="FNanchor_1543_1543" href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a></p>

<p>The manner in which the use of torture thus in time was
superimposed upon the existing customs of Europe is clearly
shown in the law of Lubeck. The mercantile law of the
Middle Ages disregarded, as we have seen, all the irregular
forms of evidence, such as the ordeal, the judicial duel, &amp;c.,
and it naturally was not favorable to torture. As the chief of
the Hanse-towns Lubeck, therefore, in its legislation preserved
the principles of the mercantile law, but in time these came to
be expounded by a race of lawyers imbued with the ideas of
the imperial jurisprudence, and little was left of the primitive
simplicity of the original code. Thus the latter, when treating
of adultery, simply provides that the accused must clear
himself by oath, or be held guilty of the charge; but a commentary
on it, written in 1664, assumes that as the crime is a
peculiarly secret one recourse must be at once had to torture
where there is colorable ground for suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1544_1544" href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a></p>

<p>About this time we also find, in the increasing rigor and
gradual systematizing of the Inquisition, an evidence of the
growing disposition to resort to torture, and a powerful element
in extending and facilitating its introduction. The
Church had been actively engaged in discountenancing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
extirpating the ordeal, and it now threw the immense weight
of its authority in favor of the new process of extorting confessions.
When Frederic II., from 1220 to 1239, published
his three constitutions directed against heresy, cruel and unsparing
as they were, they contained no indication that torture
was even contemplated as a mode of investigation. In conformity
with the provisions of the Lateran Council of 1215,
parties suspected on insufficient evidence were directed to
prove their innocence by some fitting mode of purgation, and
the same instructions were given by Gregory IX. in 1235.<a id="FNanchor_1545_1545" href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a>
In 1252, however, when Innocent IV. issued his elaborate
directions for the guidance of the Inquisition in Tuscany and
Lombardy, he ordered the civil magistrates to extort from all
heretics by torture not merely a confession of their own guilt,
but an accusation of all who might be their accomplices; and
this derives additional significance from his reference to similar
proceedings as customary in trials of thieves and robbers.<a id="FNanchor_1546_1546" href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a>
It shows the progress made during the quarter of the century
and the high appreciation entertained by the Church for the
convenience of the new system.</p>

<p>At first the canons of the Church, which prohibited ecclesiastics
from being concerned in such matters, or even from
being present, under pain of “irregularity,” rendered it
necessary for inquisitors to call in the secular executioners;
but this interfered with promptness and secrecy, and the difficulty
was removed with characteristic indirection. A series
of papal bulls from 1256 to 1266 authorized inquisitors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
their assistants to grant mutual absolution and dispensation
for irregularities,<a id="FNanchor_1547_1547" href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a> and thus they were able to take the business
of inflicting torture into their own hands—an opportunity of
which they availed themselves fully.</p>

<p>As yet, however, this did not extend beyond Italy. There
is extant a tract, written not long after this time, containing
very minute instructions as to the established mode of dealing
with the Waldensian sectaries known as the “Poor Men of
Lyons.” It gives directions to break down their strength and
overcome their fortitude by solitary confinement, starvation,
and terror, but it abstains from recommending the infliction
of absolute and direct torture, while its details are so full that
the omission is fair negative evidence that such measures were
not then customary.<a id="FNanchor_1548_1548" href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a></p>

<p>The whole system of the Inquisition, however, was such as
to render the resort to torture inevitable. Its proceedings
were secret; the prisoner was carefully kept in ignorance of
the exact charges against him, and of the evidence upon
which they were based. He was presumed to be guilty, and
his judges bent all their energies to force him to confess. To
accomplish this, no means were too base or too cruel. According
to the tract just quoted, pretended sympathizers were
to be let into his dungeon, whose affected friendship might
entrap him into an unwary admission; officials armed with
fictitious evidence were directed to frighten him with assertions
of the testimony obtained against him from supposititious
witnesses; and no resources of fraud or guile were to be spared
in overcoming the caution and resolution of the poor wretch
whose mind, as we have seen, had been carefully weakened
by solitude, suffering, hunger, and terror. From this to the
rack and estrapade the step was easily taken, and was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
long delayed. In 1301, we find even Philippe le Bel protesting
against the cruelty of Fulk, the Dominican Inquisitor, and
interfering to protect his subjects from the refinements of torture
to which, on simple suspicion of heresy, unfortunate victims
were habitually exposed.<a id="FNanchor_1549_1549" href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> Yet when, a few years later,
the same monarch resolved upon the destruction of the Templars,
he made the Inquisition the facile instrument to which
he resorted, as a matter of course, to extort from De Molay
and his knights, with endless repetition of torments, the confessions
from which he hoped to recruit his exhausted treasury
with their broad lands and accumulated riches.<a id="FNanchor_1550_1550" href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a></p>

<p>The history of the Inquisition, however, is too large a subject
to be treated here in detail, and it can only be alluded to
for the purpose of indicating its influence upon secular law.
That influence was immense. The legists who were endeavoring
to eradicate the feudal customs could not expect the
community to share their admiration of the Roman law, and
naturally grasped with eagerness the advantage offered them
in adducing the example of ecclesiastical institutions. In
founding their new system they could thus hardly avoid
copying that which presented itself under all the authority
of an infallible Church, and which had been found to work
so successfully in unveiling the most secret of hidden crimes,
those of faith and belief.<a id="FNanchor_1551_1551" href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> When, therefore, men were taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
that in these cases the ordinary forms and safeguards of the
law were not to stand in the way of the public good, a principle
was enunciated capable of illimitable development.</p>

<p>About the time when Innocent IV. was prescribing torture
in Italy, we find the first evidence of its authoritative use in
France as an ordinary legal procedure. In December, 1254,
an assembly of the nobles of the realm at Paris adopted an
ordonnance regulating many points in the administration of
justice. Among these occurs an order that persons of good
reputation, even though poor, shall not be put to the torture
on the evidence of one witness, lest, on the one hand, they
may be forced to convict themselves falsely, or, on the other,
to buy themselves off from the infliction.<a id="FNanchor_1552_1552" href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a></p>

<p>This would seem to indicate that the system of judicial torture
was so completely established that its evils and abuses had
begun to render themselves apparent and to require restrictive
legislation. Yet the contemporaneous remains of jurisprudence
show no trace of the custom, and some of them are of a nature
to render their silence a negative proof of no little weight. To
this period, for instance, belongs the earliest extant coutumier
of Normandy, published by Ludewig, and it contains no allusion
to torture. The same may be said of the <i>For de Béarn</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
granted in 1288, and recently printed by MM. Mazure and
Hatoulet, which is very full in its details of judicial procedure.
The collection of the laws of St. Louis, known as the <i>Établissements</i>,
is likewise free from any instructions or directions as
to its application, though it could scarcely have been omitted
had it formed part of the admitted jurisprudence of the age.
It may be argued, indeed, that these codes and laws assume
the existence of torture, and therefore make no reference to it,
but such an argument would not hold good with respect to
the books of practice which shrewd and experienced lawyers
commenced at that time to draw up for the guidance of courts
in the unsettled period of conflict between the ancient feudal
customs and the invading civil law. For instance, no text-book
can well be more minute than the <i>Livres de Jostice et de
Plet</i>, written about the year 1260, by a lawyer of the school
of Orleans, then celebrated as the headquarters of the study of
the imperial jurisprudence. He manifests upon almost every
page his familiar acquaintance with the civil and canon law,
and he could not possibly have avoided some reference to torture
if it had been even an occasional resource in the tribunals
in which he pleaded, and yet he does not in any way allude
to it.</p>

<p>The same conclusion is derivable from the <i>Coutumes du
Beauvoisis</i>, written about 1270 by Philippe de Beaumanoir.
In his position as royal bailli, Beaumanoir had obtained the
fullest possible familiarity with all the practical secular jurisprudence
of his day, and his tendencies were naturally in
favor of the new system with which St. Louis was endeavoring
to break down the feudal customs. Yet, while he details
at much length every step in all the cases, civil and criminal,
that could be brought into Court, he makes no allusion to
torture as a means of obtaining evidence. In one passage, it
is true, he seems to indicate that a prisoner could be forced,
while in prison, to criminate himself, but the terms employed
prove clearly that this was not intended to include the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
administration of torment.<a id="FNanchor_1553_1553" href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> In another place, moreover, when
treating of robberies, he directs that all suspected parties
should be long and closely confined, but that, if they cannot
be convicted by external evidence, they must at last be discharged.<a id="FNanchor_1554_1554" href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a>
All this is clearly incompatible with the theory of
torture.</p>

<p>The <i>Conseil</i> of Pierre de Fontaines, which was probably
written about the year 1260, affords the same negative evidence
in its full instructions for all the legal proceedings then
in use. In these three works, notwithstanding the reforms
attempted by St. Louis, the legist seems to imagine no other
solution than the wager of battle for the settlement of doubtful
cases, wherein testimony is insufficient. The form of trial is
still public, in the feudal or royal courts, and every opportunity
is given both for the attack and the defence. The
work of de Fontaines, moreover, happens to furnish another
proof that he wrote at the commencement of a transition
period, during which the use of torture was introduced. In
the oldest MSS. of his work, which are considered to date
from 1260 to 1280, there is a passage to the effect that a
man convicted of crime may appeal, if he has not confessed,
or, when he has confessed, if it has been in consequence of
some understanding (<i>covent</i>). In later MSS., transcribed in
the early part of the fourteenth century, the word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span> “covent”
is replaced by “tourmenz,”<a id="FNanchor_1555_1555" href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> thus showing not only the introduction
of torture during the interval, but also that a conviction
obtained by it was not final.</p>

<p>The Ordonnance of 1254, indeed, as far as it relates to torture,
is asserted by modern criticism to have been applicable
only to Languedoc.<a id="FNanchor_1556_1556" href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> If so, its importance is reduced to a minimum,
for in the document as registered in the council of Béziers
in 1255, the section respecting torture is omitted,<a id="FNanchor_1557_1557" href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> and this
would seem to show that even in the south, where the traditions
of the Roman law were continuous, torture was still
regarded as an innovation not to be legally sanctioned. Still
it was gradually winning its way against popular repugnance,
for we have in 1260 a charter from Alphonse de Poitiers to
the town of Auzon (Auvergne), in which he grants exemption
from torture in all trials irrespective of the gravity of the
crime.<a id="FNanchor_1558_1558" href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a></p>

<p>While giving due weight, however, to all this, we must not
lose sight of the fact that the laws and regulations prescribed
in royal ordonnances and legal text-books were practically
applicable only to a portion of the population. All non-nobles,
who had not succeeded in extorting special privileges
by charter from their feudal superiors, were exposed to
the caprices of barbarous and irresponsible power. It was a
maxim of feudal law that God alone could intervene between
the lord and his villein—“Mès par notre usage n’a-il, entre
toi et ton vilein, juge fors Deu”<a id="FNanchor_1559_1559" href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a>—the villein being by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
means necessarily a serf; and another rule prohibited absolutely
the villein from appealing from the judgment of his
lord.<a id="FNanchor_1560_1560" href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> Outside of law, and unauthorized by coutumiers and
ordonnances, there must, under such institutions, have been
habitually vast numbers of cases in which the impatient
temper of the lord would seek a solution of doubtful matters,
in the potent cogency of the rack or scourge, rather than
waste time or dignity in endeavoring to cross-question the
truth out of a quick-witted criminal.</p>

<p>Still, as an admitted legal procedure, the introduction of
torture was very gradual. The <i>Olim</i>, or register of cases
decided by the Parlement of Paris, extends, with some intervals,
from 1255 to 1318, and the paucity of affairs recorded
in which torture was used shows that it could not have been
habitually resorted to during this period. The first instance,
indeed, only occurs in 1283, when the Bishop of Amiens
complains of the bailli of that town for having tried and tortured
three clerks in defiance of the benefit of clergy which
entitled them to exemption from secular jurisdiction. The
bailli pleaded ignorance of their ecclesiastical character, and
his plea was admitted as sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_1561_1561" href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> The next instance of
the use of torture is found in 1299, when the royal bailli
of Senlis cites the mayor and jurats of that town before the
Parlement, because in a case of theft they had applied the
question to a suspected criminal; and although theft was
within their competence, the bailli argued that torture was an
incident of “haute justice” which the town did not possess.
The decision was in favor of the municipality.<a id="FNanchor_1562_1562" href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a> The next
year (1300) we find a clerk, wearing habit and tonsure, complaining
that the royal officials of the town of Villeneuve in
Rouergue had tortured him in divers ways, with ropes and
heavy weights, heated eggs and fire, so that he was crippled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
and had been forced to expend three hundred livres Tournois
in medicines and physicians. This, with other proper damages,
he prays may be made good to him by the perpetrators,
and the arrêt of the Parlement orders their persons and
property to be seized, and their possessions valued, in order
that the amount may be properly assessed among them.<a id="FNanchor_1563_1563" href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a>
Philippe le Bel, notwithstanding his mortal quarrel with the
papacy—or perhaps in consequence of it—was ever careful
of the rights and privileges of the clergy, among which the
immunity from secular jurisdiction and consequently from
torture was prominent. The case evidently turned upon that
point.</p>

<p>The fourth case does not present itself until 1306. Two
Jews, under accusation of larceny by their brethren, complain
that they had been illegally tortured by the bailli of Bourges,
and though one of them under the infliction had confessed to
complicity, the confession is retracted and damages of three
thousand livres Tournois are demanded. On the other hand,
the bailli maintains that his proceedings are legal, and asks to
have the complainants punished in accordance with the confession.
The Parlement adopts a middle course; it acquits
the Jews and awards no damages, showing that the torture
was legal and a retracted confession valueless.<a id="FNanchor_1564_1564" href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a></p>

<p>The fifth case, which occurs in 1307, is interesting as
having for its reporter no less a personage than Guillaume de
Nogaret, the captor of Boniface VIII. A certain Guillot de
Ferrières, on a charge of robbery, had been tried by the
judge of Villelongue and Nicolas Bourges, royal chatelain of
Mont-Ogier. The latter had tortured him repeatedly and
cruelly, so that he was permanently crippled, and his uncle,
Étienne de Ferrières, Chatelain of Montauban, claims damages.
The decision condemns Nicolas Bourges in a mulct of
one thousand livres Tournois, half to Guillot for his sufferings
and half to Étienne for his expenses, besides a fine to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
crown.<a id="FNanchor_1565_1565" href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> It is evident that judges were not allowed to inflict
unlimited torment at their pleasure.</p>

<p>The sixth case, occurring in 1310, may be passed over, as
the torture was not judicial, but merely a brutal outrage by a
knight on a noble damsel who resisted his importunities:
though it may be mentioned that of the fine inflicted on him,
fifteen hundred livres Tournois enured to the crown and only
one hundred to the victim.<a id="FNanchor_1566_1566" href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a></p>

<p>The seventh case took place in 1312, when Michael de
Poolay, accused of stealing a sum of money from Nicolas
Loquetier, of Rouen, was subjected to a long imprisonment
and torture at Château-Neuf de Lincourt, and was then
brought to the Châtelet at Paris, where he was again examined
without confession or conviction. Meanwhile, the
real criminal confessed the theft, and Nicolas applies to the
Parlement for the liberation of Michael, which is duly granted.<a id="FNanchor_1567_1567" href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a></p>

<p>A long interval then occurs, and we do not hear of torture
again until 1318, when Guillaume Nivard, a money-changer
of Paris, was accused of coining, and was tortured by the
Prevôt of the Châtelet. He contends that it was illegal,
while the Prevôt asserts that his jurisdiction empowered him
to administer it. The Parlement investigates the case, and
acquits the prisoner, but awards him no damages.<a id="FNanchor_1568_1568" href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a></p>

<p>The essentially common-place and trivial character of these
cases has its interest in showing that the practice of appealing
to the Parlement was not confined to weighty matters, and
therefore that the few instances in which torture was involved
in such appeals afford a fair index of the rarity of its use
during this period. These cases, too, have seemed to me
worth reciting, as they illustrate the principles upon which its
application was based in the new jurisprudence, and the tentative
and uncertain character of the progress by which the
primitive customs of the European races were gradually becoming
supplanted by the resuscitated Roman law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span></p>

<p>A few instances, moreover, are on record in which torture
was used in affairs of state. Thus in 1304 we find Charles of
Valois torturing a Flemish beguine who was accused of an attempt
to poison him. The mode adopted was the application
of fire to the soles of the victim’s feet, and though she was
said to have confessed, still he liberated her after a short imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_1569_1569" href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a>
In the frightful scandal, also, of the daughters-in-law
of Philippe le Bel, which occurred in 1314, though
torture does not seem to have been used in examining the
principals, either the princesses or their paramours, it was
freely employed upon the numerous persons who were accused
as accessories.<a id="FNanchor_1570_1570" href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a> In 1315, during the long trial of Enguerrand
de Marigny, sacrificed after the death of Philippe le Bel to the
hatred of Charles of Valois, torture was freely used to obtain
evidence from his dependents;<a id="FNanchor_1571_1571" href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> and in the same year Raoul
de Presles, accused of the death of the late king, was exposed
to torture without obtaining a confession, and was finally liberated.<a id="FNanchor_1572_1572" href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a></p>

<p>This undermining of the ancient customs had not been
allowed to continue uninterrupted by protest and resistance.
In the closing days of the reign of Philippe le Bel the feudal
powers of France awoke to the danger with which they were
menaced by the extension of the royal prerogative during the
preceding half-century. A league was formed which seemed
to threaten the existence of the institutions so carefully nurtured
by St. Louis and his successors. It was too late, however,
and though the storm broke on the new and untried
royalty of Louis Hutin, the crown lawyers were already too
powerful for the united seigneurie of the kingdom. When the
various provinces presented their complaints and their demands
for the restoration of the old order of things, they were met
with a little skilful evasion, a few artful promises, some con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>cessions
which were readily withdrawn, and negatives carefully
couched in language which seemed to imply assent.</p>

<p>Among the complaints we find the introduction of torture
enumerated as an innovation upon the established rights of the
subject, but the lawyers who drew up the replies of the king
took care to infringe as little as they could upon a system
which their legal training led them to regard as an immense
improvement in procedure, especially as it enabled them to
supersede the wager of battle, which they justly regarded as
the most significant emblem of feudal independence.</p>

<p>The movement of the nobles resulted in obtaining from the
king a series of charters for the several provinces, by which he
defined, as vaguely, indeed, as he could, the extent of royal
jurisdiction claimed, and in which he promised to relieve them
from certain grievances. In some of these charters, as in those
granted to Britanny, to Burgundy, and to Amiens and Vermandois,
there is no allusion made to torture.<a id="FNanchor_1573_1573" href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> In the two latter,
the right to the wager of battle is conceded, which may explain
why the nobles of those provinces were careless to protect
themselves from a process which they could so easily avoid
by an appeal to the sword. In the charter of Languedoc, all
that Louis would consent to grant was a special exemption to
those who had enjoyed the dignity of capitoul, consul, or decurion
of Toulouse and to their children, and even this trifling
concession did not hold good in cases of <i>lèse-majesté</i> or
other matters particularly provided for by law; the whole
clause, indeed, is borrowed from the Roman law, which may
have reconciled Louis’s legal advisers to it, more especially
as, for the first time in French jurisprudence, it recognized the
crime of <i>lèse-majesté</i>, which marked the triumph of the civil
over the feudal law.<a id="FNanchor_1574_1574" href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> Normandy only obtained a vague promise
that no freeman should be subjected to torture unless he were
the object of violent presumptions in a capital offence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
that the torture should be so regulated as not to imperil life
or limb; and though the Normans were dissatisfied with this
charter, and succeeded in getting a second one some months
later, they gained nothing on this point.<a id="FNanchor_1575_1575" href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a></p>

<p>The official documents concerning Champagne have been
preserved to us more in detail. The nobles of that province
complained that the royal prevôts and serjeants entered upon
their lands to arrest their men and private persons, whom they
then tortured in defiance of their customs and privileges (“contre
leurs coustumes et libertez”). To this Louis promised to
put an end. The nobles further alleged that, in contravention
of the ancient usages and customs of Champagne (“contre les
us et coustumes enciens de Champagne”), the royal officers
presumed to torture nobles on suspicion of crime, even though
not caught in the act, and without confession. To this Louis
vaguely replied that for the future no nobles should be tortured,
except under such presumptions as might render it
proper, in law and reason, to prevent crime from remaining
unpunished; and that no one should be convicted unless confession
was persevered in for a sufficient time after torture.<a id="FNanchor_1576_1576" href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a>
This, of course, was anything but satisfactory, and the Champenois
were not disposed to accept it; but all that they could
obtain after another remonstrance was a simple repetition of
the promise that no nobles should be tortured except under
capital accusations.<a id="FNanchor_1577_1577" href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> The struggle apparently continued, for,
in 1319, we find Philippe le Long, in a charter granted to
Périgord and Quercy, promising that the proceedings preliminary
to torture should be had in the presence of both parties,
doubtless to silence complaints as to the secret character which
criminal investigations were assuming.<a id="FNanchor_1578_1578" href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span></p>

<p>The use of torture was thus permanently established in the
judicial machinery of France as one of the incidents in the
great revolution which destroyed the feudal power. Even
yet, however, it was not universal, especially where communes
had the ability to preserve their franchises. Count Beugnot
has published, as an appendix to the <i>Olim</i>, a collection
known as the <i>Tout Lieu de St. Disier</i>, consisting of 314
decisions of doubtful cases referred by the magistrates of St.
Dizier to the city of Ypres for solution, as they were bound to
do by their charter. This especially directed that all cases
not therein provided for should be decided according to the
customs of Ypres, and consequently, for two hundred and fifty
years, whenever the eschevins of the little town in Champagne
felt in doubt they referred the matter to the lordly burghers
of Flanders as to a court of last resort. In the <i>Tout Lieu</i>
the cases date mostly from the middle third of the fourteenth
century, and were selected as a series of established precedents.
The fact that, throughout the whole series, torture is
not alluded to in a single instance shows that it was a form of
procedure unknown to the court of the eschevins of St. Dizier,
and even to the superior jurisdiction of the bailli of their suzerain,
the Seigneur of Dampierre. Many of these cases seem
peculiarly adapted to the new inquisitorial system. Thus, in
1335, a man was attacked and wounded in the street at night.
A crowd collected at his cries, and he named the assailant.
No rule was more firmly established than the necessity of two
impartial witnesses to justify condemnation, and the authorities
of St. Dizier, not knowing what course to take, applied as
usual for instructions to the magistrates of Ypres. The latter
defined the law to be that the court should visit the wounded
man on his sick-bed and adjure him by his salvation to tell
the truth. If on this he named any one and subsequently
died, the accused should be pronounced guilty; if, on the
other hand, he recovered, then the accused should be treated
according to his reputation: that is, if of good fame, he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
be acquitted; if of evil repute, he should be banished.<a id="FNanchor_1579_1579" href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a> No
case more inviting under the theory of torture could well be
imagined, and yet neither the honest burghers of St. Dizier
nor the powerful magnates of Ypres seem to have entertained
the idea of its application. So, again, when the former inquire
what proof is sufficient when a man accuses another of
stealing, the answer is that no evidence will convict, unless
the goods alleged to be stolen are found in the possession of
the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1580_1580" href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> The wealthy city of Lille equally rejected the
process of torture. The laws in force there, about the year
1350, prescribe that in cases of homicide conviction ought to
be based upon absolute evidence, but where this is unattainable
then the judges are allowed to decide on mere opinion
and belief, for uncertain matters cannot be rendered certain.<a id="FNanchor_1581_1581" href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a>
In such a scheme of legislation, the extortion of a confession
as a condition precedent to condemnation can evidently find
no place.</p>

<p>Attempts to introduce torture in Aquitaine were apparently
made, but they seem to have been resisted. In the Coutumier
of Bordeaux, during the fourteenth century there is a
significant declaration that the sages of old did not wish to
deprive men of their liberties and privileges. Torture, therefore,
was prohibited in the case of all citizens except those of
evil repute and declared to be infamous. The nearest approach
to it that was permitted was tying the hands behind
the back, without using pulleys to lift the accused from the
ground.<a id="FNanchor_1582_1582" href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>

<p>By this time, however, places where torture was not used
were exceptional. An allusion to it in 1335 in the register of
the court of the Priory of St. Martin-des-Champs shows that
already it was not confined to the royal jurisdiction, but that
it was recognized as an incident to the possession of haute
justice.<a id="FNanchor_1583_1583" href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> By a document of 1359, it appears that it was the
custom to torture all malefactors brought to the Châtelet of
Paris,<a id="FNanchor_1584_1584" href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> and though privileged persons constantly endeavored
to exempt themselves from it, as the consuls of Villeneuve in
1371,<a id="FNanchor_1585_1585" href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> and the Seigneur d’Argenton in 1385,<a id="FNanchor_1586_1586" href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a> other privileged
persons as constantly sought to obtain the power of inflicting
it, as shown in the charter of Milhaud, granted in 1369,
wherein the consuls of that town are honored with the special
grace that no torture shall be administered except in their
presence, if they desire to attend.<a id="FNanchor_1587_1587" href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> At the end of the century,
indeed, the right to administer torture in cases wherein the
accused denied the charge was regularly established among
the privileges of haute justiciers.<a id="FNanchor_1588_1588" href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a></p>

<p>By this time criminal procedures were fully recognized as
divisible into two classes—the <i>procès ordinaire</i> and the <i>procès
extraordinaire</i>. The former of these was carried on by the
form of inquest, the latter by inquisition, in which torture
was habitually employed. There were no definite rules to
determine the class to which any given case might be referred,
and though at the beginning of the fourteenth century the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
<i>procès ordinaire</i>, as its name infers, was the usual mode of
trying criminals, gradually the choice between the two was
left to the discretion of the judge, and this discretion leaned
so constantly in favor of the <i>procès extraordinaire</i> that by the
close of the century it had become the rule rather than the
exception.<a id="FNanchor_1589_1589" href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a></p>

<p>This is very clearly shown by the records of the Châtelet
of Paris from 1389 to 1392,<a id="FNanchor_1590_1590" href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> which enable us to form a tolerably
distinct idea of the part assigned to torture in the
criminal procedure of this period. It had virtually become
the main reliance of the tribunal, for the cases in which it
was not employed appear to be simply exceptional. Noble
blood afforded no exemption, for gentlemen were placed
on the rack for petty crimes as freely as roturiers.<a id="FNanchor_1591_1591" href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> No
avenue of escape was open to the miserable culprit. If he
denied the alleged offence, he was tortured at once for a confession,
and no settled rules seem to have existed as to the
amount of evidence requisite to justify it. Thus, in one case,
a man on the <i>tresteau</i> relating the misdeeds of his evil life
chanced to mention the name of another as a professional
thief. The latter was immediately arrested, and though there
was no specific crime charged against him, he was tortured
repeatedly until sufficient confession was extracted from him
to justify his execution.<a id="FNanchor_1592_1592" href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a> If, on the other hand, the prisoner
persistently denied his guilt there was no limit to the repetition
of the torture, and yet, even when no confession could be
thus extracted, the failure did not always serve to exempt him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
from punishment.<a id="FNanchor_1593_1593" href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> If he retracted the confession extorted
from him, he was tortured again and again until he ceased to
assert his innocence, for it was a positive necessity for conviction
that the confession under torture should be confirmed by
the prisoner without constraint—“sans aucune force, paour ou
contrainte de gehayne”—when sentence came to be passed
upon him outside of the torture-chamber.</p>

<p>If, again, the luckless prisoner confessed the crime of which
he stood accused, he was further promptly tortured to find
out what other offences he might at some previous time have
committed. This, which we will see hereafter, continued to
be to the end one of the worst abuses of the torture system,
was already a practice at least half a century old,<a id="FNanchor_1594_1594" href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> and it had
become so habitual that it is scarcely worth while to cite
particular examples, though the case of Gervaise Caussois
may be briefly referred to on account of its quaintness.
Arrested for stealing some iron tools, he promptly confessed
the crime. Among the reasons on record for proceeding to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
torture him in order to elicit an account of his other presumed
misdemeanors, is included the excellent one, “attendu qu’il
est scabieux.” Under the torment the poor wretch accused
himself of some other petty thefts, but even this did not
satisfy his examiners, for the next day he was again brought
before them and bound to the <i>tresteau</i>, when he confessed a
few more trifling larcenies. Having apparently thus obtained
enough evidence to satisfy their consciences, his judges mercifully
hanged him without further infliction.<a id="FNanchor_1595_1595" href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> In fact, the
whole matter apparently was left very much to the discretion
of the court, which seems to have been bound by no troublesome
limitations to its curiosity in investigating the past career
of the miserable beings brought before it.</p>

<p>How that discretion was habitually exercised may be judged
from the case of a certain Fleurant de Saint-Leu, who was
brought up for examination Jan. 4, 1390, on the charge of
stealing a silver buckle. Denying the accusation, he was
twice tortured with increasing severity, until he confessed the
alleged crime, but asserted it to be a first offence. On Jan.
8th the court decided that as the petty theft was insufficient
to merit death, he should be tortured repeatedly to ascertain
whether he had not been guilty of something else worthy of
capital punishment. On that day he was therefore thrice
exposed to the question, in an ascending scale of severity, but
without success. On the 13th he was again twice tortured,
when the only admission that rewarded the examiners was that
three years before he had married a prostitute at Senlis. This
uncommon obduracy seems to have staggered the court, for
he was then kept in his dungeon until April 9th, when his
case was carefully considered, and though nothing had been
extorted from him since his first confession, he was condemned,
and was hanged the same day—thus proving how purely
gratuitous were the fearful sufferings to which he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
exposed in order to gratify the curiosity or satisfy the consciences
of his remorseless judges.<a id="FNanchor_1596_1596" href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a></p>

<p>Few criminals, however, gave so much trouble as Fleurant.
The “petit et grand tresteaux,” on which the torture was customarily
administered, were a sword which cut many a Gordian
knot, and, by rendering the justice of the Châtelet sharp and
speedy, saved the court a world of trouble. It was by no
means unusual for the accused to be arraigned, tortured, condemned,
and executed all on the same day,<a id="FNanchor_1597_1597" href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> and not a few of
the confessions read as though they were fictions composed by
the accused in order to escape by death from the interminable
suffering to which they were exposed. The sameness frequently
visible in a long catalogue of crimes seems to indicate this, but
it is especially notable in some singular cases of parties accused
of poisoning wells throughout the north of France, when there
was an evident necessity for the authorities to satisfy the excited
populace by procuring them some victims, and the unfortunate
wretches who were arrested on suspicion were tortured
until they were ready to accuse themselves of anything.<a id="FNanchor_1598_1598" href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> In one
case, indeed, the prisoner stated that he had known a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
tortured at the Châtelet with such severity that he died in the
hands of his torturers, and for himself he declared, after one
or two inflictions, that he would confess whatever would relieve
him from a repetition of what he had endured.<a id="FNanchor_1599_1599" href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a></p>

<p>Yet, with all this reckless disregard of the plainest principles
of justice, the torture process had not yet entirely obliterated
the memory of the old customary law. The prisoner was not,
as we shall see practised hereafter, kept in ignorance of the
charges against him and of the adverse testimony. The accusation
was always made known to him, and when witnesses
were examined, the record is careful to specify that it was
done in his presence.<a id="FNanchor_1600_1600" href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a> The court deliberated in private, but
the prisoner was brought before it to receive condemnation
either to torture or to death. Facilities were likewise afforded
him to procure evidence in his favor, when the swift justice of
the Châtelet might allow him leisure for such defence, for his
friends were allowed to see him in prison during the intervals
of his trial.<a id="FNanchor_1601_1601" href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a></p>

<p>Thus, in the capital, the royal power, aided by the civil
lawyers, was fast encroaching upon all the liberties of the
subject, but in the provinces a more stubborn resistance was
maintained. It was some little time after the period under
consideration that the ancient Coutumier of Britanny was
compiled, and in it we find the use of torture, though fully
established as a judicial expedient, yet subjected to much
greater restrictions. A prisoner, accused of a capital crime
and denying the charge, was liable to torture only if positive
evidence was unattainable, and then only if he had been under
accusation within the previous five years. Moreover, if he
endured its application three times without confession, he
was discharged acquitted as one in whose favor God would
work a miracle<a id="FNanchor_1602_1602" href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a>—thus showing how torture was assimilated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
in the popular mind to the ordeal which it had supplanted.
Such escape indeed might well be regarded as a miracle, for
the reckless barbarity of the age had little scruple in pushing
the administration of the question to the utmost rigor. About
this same time, the Council of Reims, in 1408, drew up a
series of instructions for the bishops of the province in visiting
their dioceses; and among the abuses enumerated for
investigation was whether the judges were in the habit of
torturing prisoners to death on feast days.<a id="FNanchor_1603_1603" href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> It was not the
cruelty, but the sacrilege to which the Church took exception.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even in Germany, the citadel of feudalism, the progress
of the new ideas and the influence of the Roman law had
spread to such an extent that in the Golden Bull of Charles
IV., in 1356, there is a provision allowing the torture of
slaves to incriminate their masters in cases of sedition against
any prince of the empire;<a id="FNanchor_1604_1604" href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> and the form of expression employed
shows that this was an innovation. Liége, which at
that period formed part of the empire, furnishes us with a
case in 1376 which shows not only that torture then was an
habitual resource in procedure, but also that it was applied
as illogically there as we have seen it in Paris. The young
wife of a burgher named Gilles Surlet was found one morning
strangled in bed. The husband, as though conscious of
innocence, at once presented himself to the authorities asserting
with fearful oaths his ignorance of the crime. A servant
girl of the household was then arrested, and she, without
torture, immediately confessed that she had committed the
murder; but the judges, not satisfied with this, submitted
her to the question, when she denied her guilt with the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
provoking constancy. Suspicion then grew against the husband,
and he was duly tortured without extorting a confession,
though at the same time he declared that the girl was
innocent; and on being taken back to his cell he strangled
himself during the night. The chronicler does not record
what was the fate of the girl, but the body of Gilles was
treated as that of a murderer—it was dragged to the place
of execution and broken on the wheel, while the superstitious
did not fail to note that on this dreary transit it was accompanied
by a black hog, which refused to be driven away until
the gallows was reached.<a id="FNanchor_1605_1605" href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a></p>

<p>In Corsica, at the same period, we find the use of torture
fully established, though subject to careful restrictions. In
ordinary cases, it could only be employed by authority of the
governor, to whom the judge desiring to use it transmitted
all the facts of the case; the governor then issued an order,
at his pleasure, prescribing the mode and degree to which it
might be applied.<a id="FNanchor_1606_1606" href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> In cases of treason, however, these limitations
were not observed, and the accused was liable to its
infliction as far and as often as might be found requisite to
effect a purpose.<a id="FNanchor_1607_1607" href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a></p>

<p>The Italian communities seem to have still at this period
preserved some limitations on the application of torture. In
Milan, in 1338, it could be only employed in capital cases
where there was evidence or public repute; it could only be
ordered by the lord of the city, his vicar, the podestà, and
the criminal judges, and even these were heavily fined if they
used it illegally or elsewhere than in the accustomed torture-chamber;
the abuse of torturing witnesses had already been
introduced, but the judge was warned that this could be done
only when the witness swore to having been personally present
and then varied in his testimony or gave false evidence.
Torture, moreover, could only be inflicted once unless new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
evidence supervened.<a id="FNanchor_1608_1608" href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a> In the statutes of Mirandola, revised in
1386, it could not be employed in cases which did not involve
corporal punishment or a fine of at least twenty-five lire; nor
even then unless the podestà submitted all the evidence to the
accused and gave him a sufficient and definite term in which
to purge himself.<a id="FNanchor_1609_1609" href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a> In Piacenza, about the same period, torture
was guarded with even more careful restrictions. There is no
indication that witnesses were exposed to it. Every effort to
obtain testimony was to be exhausted, and the accused was to
be afforded full opportunities for defence before he could be
subjected to it, and then there must be sufficient indications
of guilt, mere rumor being inadequate to justify it. Moreover,
except in cases of high treason, theft, highway robbery,
assassination, and arson, a single judge could not order it, but
the case had to be submitted to all the judges and the podestà,
who determined by a majority in secret ballot whether it should
be employed. If any of these formalities were omitted, the
confession extorted was invalid, and the judge was mulcted
in a fine of a hundred lire.<a id="FNanchor_1610_1610" href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a></p>

<p>The peculiar character of Venetian civilization made torture
almost a necessity. The atmosphere of suspicion and
secrecy which surrounded every movement of that republican
despotism, the mystery in which it delighted to shroud itself,
and the pitiless nature of its legislation conspired to render
torture an indispensable resource. How freely it was administered,
especially in political affairs, is well illustrated in the
statutes of the State Inquisition, where the merest suspicion
is sufficient to authorize its application. Thus, if a senatorial
secretary were observed to be more lavish in his expenditures
than his salary would appear to justify, he was at once suspected
of being in the pay of some foreign minister, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
spies were ordered on his track. If he were then simply
found to be absent from his house at undue hours, he was
immediately to be seized and put to the torture. So, if any
one of the innumerable secret spies employed by the inquisitors
were insulted by being called a spy, the offender was
arrested and tortured to ascertain how he had guessed the
character of the emissary.<a id="FNanchor_1611_1611" href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> Human life and human suffering
were of little account in the eyes of the cold and subtle spirits
who moulded the policy of the mistress of the Adriatic.</p>

<p>The rude mountaineers of the Valtelline preserved to a later
date their respect for the ancient guarantees of the law. In
their statutes as revised in 1548 torture is indeed permitted,
but only in case of persons accused of crimes involving the
penalty of blood. In accusations of less heinous offences and
in matters concerning money, it was strictly forbidden; and
even in cases where it was allowed it could not be employed
without the assent of the central authority of the territory.
When proceedings were had by inquisition, moreover, all the
evidence was submitted to the accused, and a sufficient delay
was accorded to him in which to frame a defence before he
could be ordered to the torture. Thus were avoided the
worst abuses to which the system had been made subservient
long before that time in all the surrounding regions.<a id="FNanchor_1612_1612" href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a></p>

<p>Other races adopted the new system with almost equal hesitation.
Thus in Hungary the first formal embodiment of torture
in the law occurs in 1514, and though the terms employed
show that it had been previously used to some extent, yet the
restrictions laid down manifest an extreme jealousy of its
abuse. Mere suspicion was not sufficient. To justify its application,
a degree of proof was requisite which was almost
competent for condemnation, and the nature of this evidence
is well exemplified in the direction that if a judge himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
witnessed a murder, he could not order the homicide to be
tortured unless there was other testimony sufficient, for he
could not be both witness and judge, and his knowledge of
the crime belonged to his private and not to his judicial capacity.<a id="FNanchor_1613_1613" href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a>
With such refinements, there would seem to be little
danger of the extension of the custom.</p>

<p>In Poland, torture does not make its appearance until the
fifteenth century, and then it was introduced gradually, with
strict instructions to the tribunals to use the most careful discretion
in its administration.<a id="FNanchor_1614_1614" href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> Until, at least, the seventeenth
century, there remained in force laws of Casimir the Great
promulgated in the fourteenth, prohibiting any prosecution
not brought by a proper accuser, in whose presence alone
could the matter be heard, thus showing that the inquisitorial
process found no foothold in the Polish courts.<a id="FNanchor_1615_1615" href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> In Russia,
the first formal allusion to it is to be found in the Ulagenié
Zakonof, a code promulgated in 1497, by Ivan III., which
merely orders that persons accused of robbery, if of evil repute,
may be tortured to supply deficiencies of evidence; but
as the duel was still freely allowed to the accused, the use of
torture must have been merely incidental.<a id="FNanchor_1616_1616" href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> From another
source, dating about 1530, we learn that it was customary to
extort confessions from witches by pouring upon them from
a height a small stream of cold water; and in cases of contumacious
and stubborn criminals, the finger-nails were
wrenched off with little wooden wedges.<a id="FNanchor_1617_1617" href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> Still, torture makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
but little show in the subsequent codes, such as the Sudebtnick,
issued in 1550, and the Sobornoié Ulagenié, promulgated in
1648.<a id="FNanchor_1618_1618" href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> In fact, these regions were still too barbarous for so
civilized a process.</p>

<p>In addition to these national jurisdictions there was a wide
field open to the use of torture in the spiritual courts established
everywhere, for it was not confined to the secular tribunals
and to the Inquisition. The latter had so fully familiarized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
the minds of churchmen with it that it came to be employed
generally in the episcopal tribunals which, through their exclusive
jurisdiction over clerks and over all matters that could
be connected with spiritual offences, had considerable criminal
business. We may assume, however, that in this respect they
were limited by the laws of the land and were debarred from
its use in countries where it was not allowed in secular matters.
In 1310 it required the most urgent pressure from Clement V.
to induce Edward II. to violate the common law by permitting
the papal emissaries to torture the English Templars, and the
King sought to conceal the illegality of the act by an order to
the gaolers which bore that the inquisitors and episcopal
ordinaries should be allowed to deal with the bodies of the
prisoners “in accordance with ecclesiastical law,”<a id="FNanchor_1619_1619" href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> showing
how completely in the minds of men torture was identified
with the spiritual courts. When the canons of the council of
Vienne were promulgated in 1317 and the inquisitor Bernard
Gui remonstrated with John XXII. against a clause intended
to diminish the abuse of torture by inquisitors, he argued that
it was a reflection on the Inquisition, because the episcopal
courts were subject to no such restrictions on its use.<a id="FNanchor_1620_1620" href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> The
Church carried this blessing with it wherever it went. When
in 1593 St. Toribio, Archbishop of Lima, sought to reform
the abuses of the episcopal courts throughout his vast province,
he issued an <i>arancel</i> or tariff of fees for all their officials.
In this we find that the executioner was not to charge more
than a peso for torturing a prisoner, while the notary was entitled
to two reales for drawing up a sentence of torture, and
one real for each folio of his record of its administration and
the confession of the accused.<a id="FNanchor_1621_1621" href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a></p>

<small>THE INQUISITORIAL PROCESS.</small></h3>


<p>During this period, while Central and Western Europe had
advanced with such rapid strides of enlightenment, the inquisitorial
process, based upon torture, had become the groundwork
of all criminal procedure, and every detail was gradually
elaborated with the most painstaking perverseness.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the influence of the
Inquisition in introducing the use of torture. Its influence
did not cease there, for with torture there gradually arose the
denial to the accused of all fair opportunity of defending himself,
accompanied by the system of secret procedure which
formed so important a portion of the inquisitorial practice.
In the old feudal courts, the prosecutor and the defendant appeared
in person. Each produced his witnesses; the case
was argued on both sides, and unless the wager of battle or
the ordeal intervened, a verdict was given in accordance with
the law after duly weighing the evidence, while both parties
were at liberty to employ counsel and to appeal to the suzerain.
When St. Louis endeavored to abolish the duel and to substitute
a system of inquests, which were necessarily to some extent
<i>ex parte</i>, he did not desire to withdraw from the accused
the legitimate means of defence, and in the Ordonnance of
1254 he expressly instructs his officers not to imprison the defendant
without absolute necessity, while all the proceedings of
the inquest are to be communicated freely to him.<a id="FNanchor_1622_1622" href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> All this
changed with time and the authoritative adoption of torture.
The theory of the Inquisition, that the suspected man was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
be hunted down and entrapped like a wild beast, that his guilt
was to be assumed, and that the efforts of his judges were to
be directed solely to obtaining against him sufficient evidence
to warrant the extortion of a confession without allowing him
the means of defence—this theory became the admitted basis
of criminal jurisprudence. The secrecy of these inquisitorial
proceedings, moreover, deprived the accused of one of the
greatest safeguards accorded to him under the Roman law of
torture. That law, as we have seen, required the formality of
inscription, by which the accuser who failed to prove his
charge was liable to the <i>lex talionis</i>, and in crimes which involved
torture in the investigation he was duly tortured.
This was imitated by the Wisigoths, and its principle was admitted
and enforced by the Church before the introduction of
the Inquisition had changed its policy;<a id="FNanchor_1623_1623" href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> but modern Europe,
in borrowing from Rome the use of torture, combined it with
the inquisitorial process, and thus in civilized Christendom it
speedily came to be used more recklessly and cruelly than
ever it had been in pagan antiquity.</p>

<p>In 1498, an assembly of notables at Blois drew up an elaborate
ordonnance for the reformation of justice in France. In this,
the secrecy of the inquisitorial process is dwelt upon with
peculiar insistence as of the first importance in all criminal
cases. The whole investigation was in the hands of the government
official, who examined every witness by himself, and
secretly, the prisoner having no knowledge of what was done,
and no opportunity of arranging a defence. After all the
testimony procurable in this one-sided manner had been
obtained, it was discussed by the judges, in council with other
persons named for the purpose, who decided whether the accused
should be tortured. He could be tortured but once,
unless fresh evidence subsequently was collected against him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
and his confession was read over to him the next day, in
order that he might affirm or deny it. A secret deliberation
was then held by the same council, which decided as to his
fate.<a id="FNanchor_1624_1624" href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a></p>

<p>This cruel system was still further perfected by Francis I.,
who, in an ordonnance of 1539, expressly abolished the inconvenient
privilege assured to the accused by St. Louis,
which was apparently still occasionally claimed, and directed
that in no case should he be informed of the accusation against
him, or of the facts on which it was based, nor be heard in
his defence. Upon examination of the <i>ex parte</i> testimony,
without listening to the prisoner, the judges ordered torture
proportioned to the gravity of the accusation, and it was
applied at once, unless the prisoner appealed, in which case
his appeal was forthwith to be decided by the superior court
of the locality.<a id="FNanchor_1625_1625" href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> The whole process was apparently based
upon the conviction that it was better that a hundred innocent
persons should suffer than that one culprit should escape, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
it would not be easy to devise a course of procedure better
fitted to render the use of torture universal. There was some
protection indeed, theoretically at least, in the provision which
held the judge responsible when an innocent prisoner was
tortured without sufficient preliminary proof to justify it; but
this salutary regulation, from the very nature of things, could
not often be enforced, and it was so contrary to the general
spirit of the age that it soon became obsolete. Thus, in
Brittany, perhaps the most independent of the French
provinces, the Coutumier, as revised in 1539, retains such a
provision,<a id="FNanchor_1626_1626" href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> but it disappears in the revision of 1580.</p>

<p>But even this was not all. Torture, as thus employed to
convict the accused, became known as the <i>question préparatoire</i>;
and, in defiance of the old rule that it could be applied
but once, a second application, known as the <i>question
définitive</i> or <i>préalable</i>, became customary, by which, after condemnation,
the prisoner was again subjected to the extremity
of torment in order to discover whether he had any accomplices,
and, if so, to identify them. In this detestable practice we
find another instance of the unfortunate influence of the Inquisition
in modifying the Roman law. The latter expressly
and wisely provided that no one who had confessed should be
examined as to the guilt of another;<a id="FNanchor_1627_1627" href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> and in the ninth century
the authors of the False Decretals had emphatically adopted
the principle, which thus became embodied in ecclesiastical
law,<a id="FNanchor_1628_1628" href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> until the ardor of the Inquisition in hunting down here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>tics
caused it to regard the conviction of the accused as a
barren triumph unless he could be forced to incriminate his
possible associates. It thus finally became a rule of the Inquisition,
promulgated by papal authority, that all who confessed
or were convicted should be tortured at the discretion
of the inquisitor to reveal the names of their accomplices.<a id="FNanchor_1629_1629" href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a></p>

<p>Torture was also generically divided into the <i>question ordinaire</i>
and <i>extraordinaire</i>—a rough classification to proportion
the severity of the infliction to the gravity of the crime or the
urgency of the case. Thus, in the most usual kind of torment,
the strappado, popularly known as the <i>Moine de Caen</i>,
the ordinary form was to tie the prisoner’s hands behind his
back with a piece of iron between them; a cord was then
fastened to his wrists by which, with the aid of a pulley, he
was hoisted from the ground with a weight of one hundred
and twenty-five pounds attached to his feet. In the extraordinary
torture, the weight was increased to two hundred and
fifty pounds, and when the victim was raised to a sufficient
height he was dropped and arrested with a jerk that dislocated
his joints, the operation being thrice repeated.<a id="FNanchor_1630_1630" href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a></p>

<p>Thus, in 1549, we see the system in full operation in the case
of Jacques de Coucy, who, in 1544, had surrendered Boulogne
to the English. This was deemed an act of treachery, but he
was pardoned in 1547; yet, notwithstanding his pardon, he
was subsequently tried, convicted, condemned to decapitation
and quartering, and also to the <i>question extraordinaire</i> to
obtain a denunciation of his accomplices.<a id="FNanchor_1631_1631" href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span></p>

<p>When Louis XIV., under the inspiration of Colbert, remoulded
the jurisprudence of France, various reforms were
introduced into the criminal law, and changes both for better
and worse were made in the administration of torture. The
Ordonnance of 1670 was drawn up by a committee of the
ablest and most enlightened jurists of the day, and it is a
melancholy exhibition of human wisdom when regarded as
the production of such men as Lamoignon, Talon, and Pussort.
The cruel mockery of the <i>question préalable</i> was retained;
and in the principal proceedings all the chances were
thrown against the prisoner. All preliminary testimony was
still <i>ex parte</i>. The accused was heard, but he was still examined
in secret. Lamoignon vainly endeavored to obtain
for him the advantage of counsel, but Colbert obstinately
refused this concession, and the utmost privilege allowed the
defence was the permission accorded to the judge, at his discretion,
to confront the accused with the adverse witnesses.
In the <i>question préliminaire</i>, torture was reserved for capital
cases, when the proof was strong and yet not enough for
conviction. During its application it could be stopped and
resumed at the pleasure of the judge, but if the accused were
once unbound and removed from the rack, it could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
repeated, even though additional evidence were subsequently
obtained.<a id="FNanchor_1632_1632" href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a></p>

<p>It was well to prescribe limitations, slender as these were;
but in practice it was found impossible to enforce them, and
they afforded little real protection to the accused when judges,
bent upon procuring conviction, chose to evade them. A contemporary
whose judicial position gave him every opportunity
of knowing the truth, remarks: “They have discovered a jugglery
of words and pretend that though it may not be permissible
to <i>repeat</i> the torture, still they have a right to <i>continue</i> it,
though there may have been an interval of three whole days.
Then, if the sufferer, through good luck or by a miracle, survives
this reduplication of agony, they have discovered the
notable resource of <i>nouveaux indices survenus</i>, to subject him
to it again without end. In this way they elude the intention
of the law, which sets some bounds to these cruelties and
requires the discharge of the accused who has endured the
question without confession, or without confirming his confession
after torture.”<a id="FNanchor_1633_1633" href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> Nor were these the only modes by which
the scanty privileges allowed the prisoner were curtailed in
practice. In 1681, a royal Declaration sets forth that, in the
jurisdiction of Grenoble, judges were in the habit of refusing
to listen to the accused, and of condemning him unheard, an
abuse which was prohibited for the future. Yet other courts
subsequently assumed that this prohibition was only applicable
to the Parlement of Grenoble, and in 1703 another Declaration
was necessary to enforce the rule throughout the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_1634_1634" href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a></p>

<p>The Ordonnance of 1670, moreover, gave formal expression
to another abuse which was equally brutal and illogical—the
employment of torture <i>avec réserve des preuves</i>. When
the judge resolved on this, the silence of the accused under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
torment did not acquit him, though the whole theory of
the question lay in the necessity of confession. He simply
escaped the death penalty, and could be condemned to any
other punishment which the discretion of the judge might
impose, thus presenting the anomaly of a man neither guilty
nor innocent, relieved from the punishment assigned by the
law to the crime for which he had been arraigned, and condemned
to some other penalty without having been convicted
of any offence. This punishing for suspicion was no new
thing. Before torture came fully into vogue, in the early part
of the fourteenth century, a certain Estevenes li Barbiers of
Abbeville was banished under pain of death for suspicion of
breach of the peace, and was subsequently tried, acquitted,
and allowed to return.<a id="FNanchor_1635_1635" href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a> About the same period a barber of
Anet and his sons were arrested by the monks of St. Martin-des-Champs
on suspicion of killing a guard who was keeping
watch over some hay. The evidence against them was insufficient,
and they were taken to the gallows as a kind of moral
torture not infrequently used in those days. Still refusing to
confess, they were banished forever under pain of hanging,
because, as the record ingenuously states, the crime was not
fully proved against them.<a id="FNanchor_1636_1636" href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> So in the records of the Parlement
of Paris there is a sentence rendered in 1402 against
Jehan Dubos, a procureur of the Parlement, and Ysabelet
his wife, for suspicion of the poisoning of another procureur,
Jehan le Charron, the first husband of Ysabelet, and Dubos
was accordingly hanged, while his wife was burnt.<a id="FNanchor_1637_1637" href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> Jean
Bodin, one of the clearest intellects of the sixteenth century,
lays it down as a rule that the penalty should be proportioned
to the proof; he ridicules as obsolete the principle that when
the evidence is not sufficient for conviction the accused should
be discharged, and mentions stripes, fines, imprisonment, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
galleys, and degradation as proper substitutes for death when
there is no evidence and only violent presumption. He gives
in illustration of this a case personally known to him of a noble
of Le Mans, who was condemned to nine years of the galleys
for violent suspicion of murder.<a id="FNanchor_1638_1638" href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> The application to the torture-process
of this determination not to allow a man to escape
unless his innocence was proved led to the illogical system of
the <i>réserve des preuves</i>.</p>

<p>The theory on which the doctors of the law proceeded was
that if there were evidence sufficient for conviction and the
judge yet tortured the criminal in surplusage without obtaining
a confession, the accused could not be condemned to the full
punishment of his offence, because the use of torture in itself
weakened the external proofs, and therefore the culprit must
be sentenced to some lighter punishment—a refinement worthy
of the inconsequential dialectics of the schools.<a id="FNanchor_1639_1639" href="#Footnote_1639_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> The cruel
absurdities which the system produced in practice are well
illustrated by a case occurring in Naples in the sixteenth century.
Marc Antonio Maresca of Sorrento was tried by the
Admiralty Court for the murder of a peasant of Miani, in the
market-place. The evidence was strong against him, but there
were no eye-witnesses, and he endured the torture without confession.
The court asserted that it had reserved the evidence,
and condemned him to the galleys for seven years. He appealed
to the High Court of the royal council, and the case
was referred to a distinguished jurisconsult, Tomaso Grammatico,
a member of the council. The latter reported that
he must be considered as innocent, after having passed through
torture without confession, and denied the right of the court to
reserve the evidence. Then, with an exhibition of the peculiar
logic characteristic of the criminal jurisprudence of the time,
he concluded that Maresca might be relegated to the islands
for five years, although it was a recognized principle of Nea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>politan
law that torture could be inflicted only in accusations of
crimes of which the penalty was greater than relegation. The
only thing necessary to complete this tissue of legal wisdom
was afforded by the council, which set aside the judgment of
the Admiralty Court, rejected the report of their colleague,
and condemned the prisoner to the galleys for three years.<a id="FNanchor_1640_1640" href="#Footnote_1640_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a>
Somewhat less complicated in its folly, but more inexcusable
from its date, was the sentence of the court of Orléans in 1740,
by which a man named Barberousse, from whom no confession
had been extorted, was condemned to the galleys for life,
because, as the sentence declared, he was <i>strongly suspected</i>
of premeditated murder.<a id="FNanchor_1641_1641" href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> A more pardonable, but not more
reasonable, example occurred at Halle in 1729, where a woman
accused of infanticide refused to confess, and as she labored
under a physical defect which rendered the application of torture
dangerous to life, the authorities, after due consideration
and consultation of physicians, spared her the torture and
banished her without conviction.<a id="FNanchor_1642_1642" href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same tendency to elude all restrictions on the use of
torture was manifested in the Netherlands, where the procedure
was scarcely known until the 16th century, and where it was
only administered systematically by the ordonnance on criminal
justice of Philip II. in 1570. When once employed it rapidly
extended until it became almost universal, both in the provinces
which threw off the yoke of Spain and in those which remained
faithful. The limits which Philip had imposed on it were soon
transcended. He had forbidden its employment in all cases
“où il n’y a plaine, demye preuve, ou bien où la preuve est
certaine et indubitable,” thus restricting it to those where
there was very strong presumption without absolute certainty.
In transcription and translation, however, the wording of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
ordonnance became changed to “plaine ou demye preuve, ou
bien où la preuve est incertaine ou douteuse,” thus allowing
it in all cases where the judge might have a doubt not of the
guilt but of the innocence of the accused; and by the time
these errors were discovered by a zealous legal antiquarian, the
customs of the tribunals had become so fixed that the attempt
to reform them was vain.<a id="FNanchor_1643_1643" href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> Even the introduction of torture
could not wholly eradicate the notion on which the ordeal
system was based, that a man under accusation must virtually
prove his innocence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Germany, torture had been reduced to a system, in 1532,
by the Emperor Charles V., whose <i>Caroline Constitutions</i>
contain a more complete code on the subject than had
previously existed, except in the records of the Inquisition.
Inconsistent and illogical, it quotes Ulpian to prove the deceptive
nature of the evidence thence derivable; it pronounces
torture to be “res dira, corporibus hominum admodum noxia
et quandoque lethalis, cui et mors ipsa prope proponenda;”<a id="FNanchor_1644_1644" href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a>
in some of its provisions it manifests extreme care and tenderness
to guard against abuses, and yet practically it is merciless
to the last degree. Confession made during torture was not
to be believed, nor could a conviction be based upon it; yet
what the accused might confess after being removed from torture
was to be received as the deposition of a dying man, and
was full evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1645_1645" href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> In practice, however, this held good only
when adverse to the accused, for he was brought before his
judge after an interval of a day or two, when, if he confirmed
the confession, he was condemned, while if he retracted it he
was at once thrust again upon the rack. In confession under
torture, moreover, he was to be closely cross-questioned, and
if any inconsistency was observable in his self-condemnation
the torture was at once to be redoubled in severity.<a id="FNanchor_1646_1646" href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
legislator thus makes the victim expiate the sins of his own
vicious system; the victim’s sufferings increase with the deficiency
of the evidence against him, and the legislator consoles
himself with the remark that the victim has only himself
to thank for it, “de se tantum non de alio quæratur.” To
complete the inconsistency of the code, it provided that confession
was not requisite for conviction; irrefragable external
evidence was sufficient; and yet even when such evidence was
had, the judge was empowered to torture in mere surplusage.<a id="FNanchor_1647_1647" href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a>
Yet there was a great show of tender consideration for the
accused. When the weight of conflicting evidence inclined
to the side of the prisoner, torture was not to be applied.<a id="FNanchor_1648_1648" href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a>
Two adverse witnesses, or one unexceptionable one, were a condition
precedent, and the legislator shows that he was in advance
of his age by ruling out all evidence resting on the
assertions of magicians and sorcerers.<a id="FNanchor_1649_1649" href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a> To guard against
abuse, the impossible effort was made to define strictly the exact
quality and amount of evidence requisite to justify torture,
and the most elaborate and minute directions were given with
respect to all the various classes of crime, such as homicide,
child-murder, robbery, theft, receiving stolen goods, poisoning,
arson, treason, sorcery, and the like;<a id="FNanchor_1650_1650" href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> while the judge
administering torture to an innocent man on insufficient
grounds was liable to make good all damage or suffering
thereby inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_1651_1651" href="#Footnote_1651_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> The amount of torment, moreover, was to
be proportioned to the age, sex, and strength of the patient;
women during pregnancy were never to be subjected to it; and
in no case was it to be carried to such a point as to cause
permanent injury or death.<a id="FNanchor_1652_1652" href="#Footnote_1652_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a></p>

<small>FINAL SHAPE OF THE TORTURE SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<p>Charles V. was too astute a ruler not to recognize the aid
derivable from the doctrines of the Roman law in his scheme
of restoring the preponderance of the Kaisership, and he lost
no opportunity of engrafting them on the jurisprudence of
Germany. In his Criminal Constitutions, however, he took
care to embody largely the legislation of his predecessors and
contemporaries, and though protests were uttered by many of
the Teutonic princes, the code, adopted by the Diet of Ratisbon
in 1532, became part and parcel of the common law of
Germany.<a id="FNanchor_1653_1653" href="#Footnote_1653_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> A fair idea of the shape assumed, under these
influences, by the criminal law in its relations with torture,
can be obtained by examining some of the legal text-books
which were current as manuals of practice from the sixteenth
to the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1654_1654" href="#Footnote_1654_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a> As most of the authors of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
works appear to condemn the principle or to lament the
necessity of torture, their instructions as to its employment
may safely be assumed to represent the most humane and enlightened
views current during the period.<a id="FNanchor_1655_1655" href="#Footnote_1655_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a> It is easy to see
from them, however, that though the provisions of the Caroline
Constitutions were still mostly in force, yet the practice had
greatly extended itself, and that the limitations prescribed for
the protection of innocence and helplessness had become of
little real effect.</p>

<p>Upon the theory of the Roman law, nobles and the learned
professions had claimed immunity from torture, and the Roman
law inspired too sincere a respect to permit a denial of
the claim,<a id="FNanchor_1656_1656" href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> yet the ingenuity of lawyers reduced the privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
to such narrow proportions that it was practically almost valueless.
For certain crimes, of course, such as <i>majestas</i>, adultery,
and incest, the authority of the Roman law admitted of no
exceptions, and to these were speedily added a number of
other offences, classed as <i>crimina excepta</i> or <i>nefanda</i>, which
were made to embrace almost all offences of a capital nature,
in which alone torture was as a rule allowable. Thus, patricide,
uxoricide, fratricide, witchcraft, sorcery, counterfeiting,
theft, sacrilege, rape, arson, repeated homicide, etc., came to
be included in the exceptional cases, and the only privileges
extended in them to nobles were that they should not be subjected
to “plebeian” tortures.<a id="FNanchor_1657_1657" href="#Footnote_1657_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a> As early as 1514, I find an
instance which shows how little advantage these prerogatives
afforded in practice. A certain Dr. Bobenzan, a citizen of
good repute and syndic of Erfurt, who both by position and
profession belonged to the excepted class, when brought up
for sentence on a charge of conspiring to betray the city, and
warned that he could retract his confession, extracted under
torture, pathetically replied—“During my examination, I was
at one time stretched upon the rack for six hours, and at
another I was slowly burned for eight hours. If I retract, I
shall be exposed to these torments again and again. I had
rather die”—and he was duly hanged.<a id="FNanchor_1658_1658" href="#Footnote_1658_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> In fact, all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
exemptions were rather theoretical than practical, and they
were speedily set aside.<a id="FNanchor_1659_1659" href="#Footnote_1659_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a></p>

<p>In Catholic countries, of course, the clergy were specially
favored, but the immunity claimed for them by the canon law
was practically reduced to nearly the same as that accorded to
nobles.<a id="FNanchor_1660_1660" href="#Footnote_1660_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a> The torture inflicted on them, however, was lighter
than in the case of laymen, and proof of a much more decided
character was required to justify their being exposed to torment.
As an illustration of this, von Rosbach remarks that
if a layman is found in the house of a pretty woman, most
authors consider the fact sufficient to justify torture on the
charge of adultery, but that this is not the case with priests,
who if they are caught embracing a woman are presumed to
be merely blessing her.<a id="FNanchor_1661_1661" href="#Footnote_1661_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> They moreover had the privilege of
being tortured only at the hands of clerical executioners, if
such were to be had.<a id="FNanchor_1662_1662" href="#Footnote_1662_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a> In Protestant territories respect for the
cloth was manifested by degrading them prior to administering
the rack or strappado.<a id="FNanchor_1663_1663" href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a></p>

<p>Some limitations were imposed as to age and strength.
Children under fourteen could not be tortured, nor the aged
whose vigor was unequal to the endurance, but the latter could
be tied to the rack, and menaced to the last extremity; and
the elasticity of the rule is manifested in a case which attracted
attention at Halle in the eighteenth century, in which a man
more than eighty years of age was decided to be fit to bear
the infliction, and only escaped by opportunely dying.<a id="FNanchor_1664_1664" href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> In
fact, Grillandus argues that age confers no immunity from torture,
but that a humane judge will inflict it only moderately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
except in atrocious crimes; as for children, though regular
torture could not be employed on them, the rod could be
legitimately used.<a id="FNanchor_1665_1665" href="#Footnote_1665_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> Insanity was likewise a safeguard, and
much discussion was had as to whether the deaf, dumb, and
blind were liable or not. Zanger decides in the affirmative
whenever, whether as principals or witnesses, good evidence
was to be expected from them;<a id="FNanchor_1666_1666" href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a> and Scialoja points out that
though deaf-mutes as a rule are not to be tortured because
they cannot dictate a confession, yet if they can read and
write so as to understand the accusation and write out what
they have to say, they are fit subjects for the torturer.<a id="FNanchor_1667_1667" href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> Pregnant
women also were exempt until forty days after childbed,
even though they had become so in prison for the express
purpose of postponing the infliction.<a id="FNanchor_1668_1668" href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> Some kinds of disease
likewise conferred exemption, and jurisconsults undertook with
their customary minuteness to define with precision this nosology
of torture, leading to discussions more prolonged than
profitable. Gout, for instance, gave rise to doubt, and some
authors were found to affirm that they knew of cases in which
gouty patients had been cured by a brisk application of the implements
of the <i>marter-kammer</i> or torture-chamber.<a id="FNanchor_1669_1669" href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a> Other
legists gravely disputed whether in the case of epileptics the
judge should bear in mind the aspects of the moon and the
equinoxes and solstices, at which times the paroxysms of the
disease were apt to be more violent. Those who thus escaped
torture on account of disease presented a problem which the
jurists solved in their ordinary fashion by condemning them
to some other punishment than that provided for the crime of
which they had been accused but not convicted.<a id="FNanchor_1670_1670" href="#Footnote_1670_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a></p>

<p>In theory the accused could be tortured only once, but this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
like all other restrictions in favor of humanity, amounted to
but little. A repetition of torture could be justified on the
ground that the first application had been light or insufficient;
the production of fresh evidence authorized a second and even
a third infliction; a failure to persevere in confession after
torture rendered a repetition requisite; and even a variation
in the confession required confirmation by the rack or strappado.<a id="FNanchor_1671_1671" href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a>
Many writers affirm that a second torture is requisite
to purge away the defect of the infamy incurred by confession
under the first, as well as to strengthen the evidence against
accomplices.<a id="FNanchor_1672_1672" href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a> In fact, some authorities go so far as to place
it entirely at the discretion of the judge whether the accused
shall be subjected or not to repeated torment without fresh
evidence,<a id="FNanchor_1673_1673" href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> and Del Rio mentions a case occurring in Westphalia
wherein a man accused of lycanthropy was tortured
twenty times.<a id="FNanchor_1674_1674" href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> This practice of repeating torture we are told
by many authorities was exceedingly common.<a id="FNanchor_1675_1675" href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a></p>

<p>Another positive rule was that torture could only be applied
in accusations involving life or limb.<a id="FNanchor_1676_1676" href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> Thus, for instance, in
provinces where usury was punishable only by confiscation,
torture could not be used to prove it, but where it entailed
also some corporal infliction, the accused could be subjected
to the rack.<a id="FNanchor_1677_1677" href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> Yet when Bologna undertook to remove the
abuses of her torture system she still allowed it in cases involving
a pecuniary fine of a hundred lire, or over.<a id="FNanchor_1678_1678" href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a> Whip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>ping
being a corporal punishment, and yet a much lighter
infliction than torture, the legists were divided as to whether
a crime for which it was the only penalty was one involving
the liability of the accused to torture, but the weight of authority,
as usual, leaned to the side of the free employment of
the rack.<a id="FNanchor_1679_1679" href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> All these fine-spun distinctions, however, were of
little moment, for Senckenberg assures us that he had known
torture to be resorted to in mercantile matters, where money
only was at stake.<a id="FNanchor_1680_1680" href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> Slaves could always be tortured in civil
suits when their testimony was required, and freemen when
there was suspicion of fraud;<a id="FNanchor_1681_1681" href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a> and it was a general rule of
mercantile law that it could be employed in accusations of
fraudulent bankruptcy.<a id="FNanchor_1682_1682" href="#Footnote_1682_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a> How easily, indeed, all these barriers
were overleaped is seen in the rule that where the penalty
was a fine, and the accused was too poor to pay it, he
could be tortured, the torture serving in lieu of punishment.
Thus, whether he was innocent or guilty, the judge was determined
that he should not escape.<a id="FNanchor_1683_1683" href="#Footnote_1683_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a> Another method in
constant use of evading the limitation in offences which by
statute did not involve torture was by depriving him of food
in prison, or stripping him of clothes in winter, the slow torment
of starvation and cold not being classed legally as torture.<a id="FNanchor_1684_1684" href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a></p>

<p>Equally absolute was the maxim that torture could not be
employed unless there was positive proof that crime of some
sort had been committed, for its object was to ascertain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
criminal and not the crime;<a id="FNanchor_1685_1685" href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> yet von Rosbach remarks that
as soon as any one claimed to have lost anything by theft, the
judges of his day hastened to torture all suspect, without waiting
to determine whether or not the theft had really been
committed as assumed;<a id="FNanchor_1686_1686" href="#Footnote_1686_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> and von Boden declares that many
tribunals were in the habit of resorting to it in cases wherein
subsequent developments showed that the alleged crime had
really not taken place, a proceeding jocosely characterized
by a brother lawyer as putting the cart before the horse, and
bridling him by the tail.<a id="FNanchor_1687_1687" href="#Footnote_1687_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> The history of torture is full of
cases illustrating its effectiveness when thus used. Boyvin du
Villars relates that during the war in Piedmont, in 1559, he
released from the dungeons of the Marquis of Masserano an
unfortunate gentleman who had been secretly kept there for
eighteen years, in consequence of having attempted to serve
a process from the Duke of Savoy on the marquis. His disappearance
having naturally been attributed to foul play, his
kindred prosecuted an enemy of the family, who, under stress
of torture, duly confessed to having committed the murder,
and was accordingly executed in a town where Masserano
himself was residing.<a id="FNanchor_1688_1688" href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a> Godelmann relates that a monument
in a church in upper Germany, representing a man broken on
a wheel, commemorated a case in which two young journeymen
set out together to make the accustomed tour of the
country. One of them returned alone, clad in the garments
of the other, and was suspected of having made way with him.
He was arrested, and in the absence of all other evidence was
promptly put to the torture, when he confessed the crime in
all its details and was executed on the wheel—soon after which
his companion returned. Another case was that of a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
man near Bremen whose widowed mother lived in adultery
with a servant. The son quarrelled with the man, who fled
and took service with another employer at a considerable distance.
His father, not knowing his departure, accused the
youth of murder, and torture speedily drew from the latter a
full confession of the crime, including his throwing the corpse
into the Weser. Not long after his execution the adulterous
serving-man reappeared and was duly put to death, as also
was his father, to make amends for the blunder of the law.<a id="FNanchor_1689_1689" href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a></p>

<p>A universal prescription existed that the torment should not
be so severe or so prolonged as to endanger life or limb or to
injure the patient permanently; but this, like all the other
precautions, was wholly nugatory. Senckenberg assures us
that he was personally cognizant of cases in which innocent
persons had been crippled for life by torture under false accusations;<a id="FNanchor_1690_1690" href="#Footnote_1690_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a>
and the meek Jesuit Del Rio, in his instructions
to inquisitors, quietly observes that the flesh should not be
wounded nor the bones broken, but that torture could scarce
be properly administered without more or less dislocation of
the joints.<a id="FNanchor_1691_1691" href="#Footnote_1691_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a> We may comfort ourselves with the assurance of
Grillandus, that cases were rare in which permanent mutilation
or death occurred under the hands of the torturer,<a id="FNanchor_1692_1692" href="#Footnote_1692_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> and
this admission lends point to the advice which Simancas gives
to judges, that they should warn the accused, when brought
into the torture-chamber, that if he is crippled or dies under
the torture he must hold himself accountable for it in not
spontaneously confessing the truth<a id="FNanchor_1693_1693" href="#Footnote_1693_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a>—a warning which was
habitually given in the Spanish Inquisition before applying
the torture. Von Boden, moreover, very justly points out
the impossibility of establishing any rules or limitations of
practical utility, when the capacity of endurance varies so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
greatly in different constitutions, and the executioners had so
many devices for heightening or lessening, within the established
bounds, the agony inflicted by the various modes of
torture allowed by law. Indeed, he does not hesitate to exclaim
that human ingenuity could not invent suffering more
terrible than was constantly and legally employed, and that
Satan himself would be unable to increase its refinements.<a id="FNanchor_1694_1694" href="#Footnote_1694_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a>
In this as in everything else the legists agreed that the discretion
of the judge was the sole and final arbiter in deciding
whether the accused was “competently” tortured—that is,
whether the number and severity of the inflictions were sufficient
to purge him of the adverse evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1695_1695" href="#Footnote_1695_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a></p>

<p>It is true that the old rules which subjected the judge to
some responsibility were still nominally in force. When torture
was ordered without a preliminary examination, or when
it was excessive and caused permanent injury, the judge was
held by some authorities to have acted through malice, and
his office was no protection against reclamation for damages.<a id="FNanchor_1696_1696" href="#Footnote_1696_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a>
Zanger also quotes the Roman law as still in force, to the
effect that if the accused dies under the torture, and the judge
has been either bribed or led away by passion, his offence is
capital, while if there had been insufficient preliminary evidence,
he is punishable at discretion.<a id="FNanchor_1697_1697" href="#Footnote_1697_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> But, on the other
hand, Baldo tells us that unless there is evidence of malice
the presumption is in favor of the judge in whose hands a
prisoner has died or been permanently crippled, for he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
assumed to have acted through zeal for justice,<a id="FNanchor_1698_1698" href="#Footnote_1698_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a> and though
there were some authorities who denied this, it seems to have
been the general practical conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_1699_1699" href="#Footnote_1699_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> The secrecy of criminal
trials, moreover, offered an almost impenetrable shield to
the judge, and the recital by Godelmann of the various kinds
of evidence by which the prisoner could prove the fact that
he had been subjected to torture shows how difficult it was to
penetrate into the secrets of the tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_1700_1700" href="#Footnote_1700_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> According to Damhouder,
indeed, the judge could clear himself by his own declaration
that he had acted in accordance with the law, and
without fraud or malice.<a id="FNanchor_1701_1701" href="#Footnote_1701_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> We are therefore quite prepared to
believe the assertion of Senckenberg that the rules protecting
the prisoner had become obsolete, and that he had seen not a
few instances of their violation without there being any idea
of holding the judge to accountability,<a id="FNanchor_1702_1702" href="#Footnote_1702_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> an assertion which is
substantially confirmed by Goetz.<a id="FNanchor_1703_1703" href="#Footnote_1703_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a></p>

<p>Not the least of the evils of the system, indeed, was its inevitable
influence upon the judge himself. He was required
by his office to be present during the infliction of torture, and
to conduct the interrogatory personally. Callousness to human
suffering, whether natural or acquired, thus became a necessity,
and the delicate conscientiousness which should be the moving
principle of every Christian tribunal was well-nigh an impossibility.<a id="FNanchor_1704_1704" href="#Footnote_1704_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a>
Nor was this all, for when even a conscientious judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
had once taken upon himself the responsibility of ordering a
fellow-being to the torture, every motive would lead him to
desire the justification of the act by the extortion of a confession;<a id="FNanchor_1705_1705" href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a>
and the very idea that he might be possibly held to
accountability, instead of being a safeguard for the prisoner
became a cause of subjecting him to additional agony. Indeed,
the prudence of persevering in torture until a confession
was reached was at least recognized, if not advised, by jurists,
and in such a matter to suggest the idea was practically to
recommend it.<a id="FNanchor_1706_1706" href="#Footnote_1706_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> Both the good and the evil impulses of the
judge were thus enlisted against the unfortunate being at his
mercy. Human nature was not meant to face such temptations,
and the fearful ingenuity which multiplied the endless
refinements of torture testifies how utterly humanity yielded
to the thirst of wringing conviction from the weaker party to
the unequal conflict, where he who should have been a passionless
arbiter was made necessarily a combatant. How
completely the prisoner thus became a quarry to be hunted
to the death is shown by the jocular remark of Farinacci, a
celebrated authority in criminal law, that the torture of sleeplessness,
invented by Marsigli, was most excellent, for out of a
hundred martyrs exposed to it not two could endure it without
becoming confessors as well.<a id="FNanchor_1707_1707" href="#Footnote_1707_1707" class="fnanchor">1707</a> Few, when once engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
in such a pursuit, could be expected to follow the example of
the Milanese judge, who resolved his doubts as to the efficacy
of torture in evidence by killing a favorite mule, and allowing
the accusation to fall upon one of his servants. The man of
course denied the offence, was duly tortured, confessed, and
persisted in his confession after torture. The judge, thus convinced
by experiment of the fallacy of the system, resigned
the office whose duties he could no longer conscientiously discharge,
and in his subsequent career rose to the cardinalate.
The mode in which these untoward results were usually treated
is illustrated in another somewhat similar case which was told
to Augustin Nicholas at Amsterdam in explanation of the fact
that the city was obliged to borrow a headsman from the
neighboring towns whenever the services of one were required
for an execution. It appears that a young man of Amsterdam,
returning home late at night from a revel, sank upon a doorstep
in a drunken sleep. A thief emptied his pockets, securing,
among other things, a dirk, with which, a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
later, he stabbed a man in a quarrel. Returning to the sleeper
he slipped the bloody weapon back to its place. The young
man awoke, but before he had taken many steps he was seized
by the watch, who had just discovered the murder. Appearances
were against him; he was tortured, confessed, persisted
in confession after torture, and was duly hanged. Soon after
the real criminal was condemned for another crime, and revealed
the history of the previous one, whereupon the States-General
of the United Provinces, using the ordinary logic of
the criminal law, deprived the city of Amsterdam of its executioner,
as a punishment for a result that was inevitable under
the system.<a id="FNanchor_1708_1708" href="#Footnote_1708_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a></p>

<p>Slight as were the safeguards with which legislators endeavored
to surround the employment of torture, they thus became
almost nugatory in practice under a system which, in the endeavor
to reduce doubts into certainties, ended by leaving
everything to the discretion of the judge. It is instructive
to see the parade of insisting upon the necessity of strong preliminary
evidence,<a id="FNanchor_1709_1709" href="#Footnote_1709_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> and to read the elaborate details as to the
exact kind and amount of testimony severally requisite in each
description of crime, and then to find that common report was
held sufficient to justify torture, or unexplained absence before
accusation, prevarication under examination, and even silence;
and it is significant of the readiness to resort to the question
on the slenderest pretexts when we see judges solemnly warned
that an evil countenance, though it may argue depravity in
general, does not warrant the presumption of actual guilt in
individual cases;<a id="FNanchor_1710_1710" href="#Footnote_1710_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> though pallor, under many circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
was considered to sanction the application of torture,<a id="FNanchor_1711_1711" href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> even as
a pot containing toads, found in the home of a suspected
witch, justified her being placed on the rack.<a id="FNanchor_1712_1712" href="#Footnote_1712_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> In fact, witchcraft,
poisoning, highway robbery, and other crimes difficult
of proof, were considered to justify the judge in proceeding to
torture on lighter indications than offences in which evidence
was more readily obtainable.<a id="FNanchor_1713_1713" href="#Footnote_1713_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a> Subtle lawyers thus exhausted
their ingenuity in discussing all possible varieties of indications,
and there grew up a mass of confused rules, wherein,
on many points, each authority contradicted the other. In a
system which thus waxed so complex, the discretion of the
judge at last became the only practical guide, and the legal
writers themselves acknowledge the worthlessness of the rules
so laboriously constructed when they admit that it is left for
his decision to determine whether the indications are sufficient
to warrant the infliction of torture.<a id="FNanchor_1714_1714" href="#Footnote_1714_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> How absolute was this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
discretion, and how it was exercised, is manifest when Damhouder
declares that in his day bloodthirsty judges were in
the habit of employing the severest torture without sufficient
proof or investigation, boasting that by its means they could
extract a confession of everything.<a id="FNanchor_1715_1715" href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> This fact was no novelty,
for the practice had existed, we may say, since the first introduction
of torture. Ippolito dei Marsigli early in the
sixteenth century speaks of judges habitually torturing without
preliminary evidence, and goes so far as to assert, with all the
weight of his supreme authority, that a victim of such wrongs
if he killed his inhuman judge could not be held guilty of
homicide nor be punished with death for the slaying.<a id="FNanchor_1716_1716" href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a> It was
perhaps to avoid this responsibility that some of these zealous
law-despisers resorted to the most irregular means to procure
evidence. Godelmann and von Rosbach both tell us that the
magistrates of their time, in the absence of all evidence, sometimes
had recourse to sorcerers and to various forms of divination
in order to obtain proof on which they could employ the
rack or strappado. Boys whose shoes were newly greased with
lard were thought to have a special power of detecting witches,
and enthusiastic judges accordingly would sometimes station
them, after duly anointing their boots, at the church doors,
so that the luckless wretches could not get out without being
recognized.<a id="FNanchor_1717_1717" href="#Footnote_1717_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a></p>

<p>How shocking was the abuse made of this arbitrary power is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
well illustrated by a case which occurred in the Spanish colony
of New Granada about the year 1580. The judges of the royal
court of Santafé had rendered themselves odious by their
cruelty and covetousness, when one morning some pasquinades
against them were found posted in the public plaza.
Diligent search failed to discover the author, but a victim
was found in the person of a young scrivener whose writing
was thought to bear some resemblance to that of the offensive
papers. He was at once seized, and though libel was not an
offence under the civil law which justified the application of
torture, he was ordered to the rack, when he solemnly warned
the judge deputed to inflict it that if he should die under it
he would summon his tormentor to answer in the presence of
God within three days. The judge was intimidated and refused
to perform the office, but another was found of sterner
stuff, who duly performed his functions without extracting a
confession, and the accused was discharged. Then a man
who desired to revenge himself on an enemy asserted that the
writing of the latter was like that of the pasquinades. Juan
Rodriguez de los Puertos, the unfortunate thus designated,
was immediately arrested with all his family. An illegitimate
son was promptly tortured, and stated that his father had written
the libels and ordered him to post them. Then Juan himself
was ordered to the rack, but, while protesting his innocence,
he begged rather to be put to death, as he was too old
to endure the torment. He was accordingly hanged, and his
son was scourged with two hundred lashes. All that was
needed to render manifest the hideous injustice of this proceeding
was developed a few years later, when the judge who
was afraid to risk the appeal of the first victim was condemned
to death for an assassination, and on the scaffold confessed
that he himself had been the author of the libels against his
brother justices.<a id="FNanchor_1718_1718" href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span></p>

<p>Such a system tends of necessity to its own extension, and
it is therefore not surprising to find that the aid of torture
was increasingly invoked. The prisoner who refused to
plead, whether there was any evidence against him or not,
could be tortured until his obstinacy gave way.<a id="FNanchor_1719_1719" href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> Even witnesses
were not spared, whether in civil suits or criminal
prosecutions.<a id="FNanchor_1720_1720" href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> It was discretionary with the judge to inflict
moderate torture on them when the truth could not otherwise
be ascertained. Witnesses of low degree could always
be tortured for the purpose of supplying the defect in their
testimony arising from their condition of life. Some jurists,
indeed, held that no witness of low or vile condition could
be heard without torture, but others maintained that poverty
alone was not sufficient to render it necessary. Witnesses
who were infamous could not be admitted to testify without
torture; those of good standing were tortured only when they
prevaricated, or when they were apparently committing perjury;<a id="FNanchor_1721_1721" href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a>
but, as this was necessarily left with the judges to determine,
the instructions for him to guide his decision by
observing their appearance and manner show how completely
the whole case was in his power, and how readily he could
extort evidence to justify the torture of the prisoner, and
then extract from the latter a confession by the same means.
In prosecutions for treason, all witnesses, irrespective of their
rank, were liable to torture,<a id="FNanchor_1722_1722" href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> so that when Pius IV., in 1560,
was determined to ruin Cardinal Carlo Caraffa, no scruple was
felt, during his trial, as to torturing his friends and retainers
to obtain the evidence upon which he was executed.<a id="FNanchor_1723_1723" href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
was a general rule that witnesses could not be tortured until
after the examination of the accused, because, if he confessed,
their evidence was superfluous; but there were exceptions even
to this, for if the criminal was not within the power of the
court, witnesses could be tortured to obtain evidence against
him in his absence.<a id="FNanchor_1724_1724" href="#Footnote_1724_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> Indeed, in the effort made early in the
sixteenth century to reform the abuse of torture in Bologna,
it was provided that if there were evidence to show that a
man was acquainted with a crime he could be tortured to
obtain evidence on which to base a prosecution, and this
before any proceedings had been commenced against the delinquent.<a id="FNanchor_1725_1725" href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a>
Evidently there was no limit to the uses to which
torture could be put by a determined legislator.</p>

<p>An ingenious plan was also adopted by which, when two
witnesses gave testimony irreconcilable with each other, their
comparative credibility was tested by torturing both simultaneously
in each other’s presence.<a id="FNanchor_1726_1726" href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> Evidence given under torture
was esteemed the best kind, and yet with the perpetually
recurring inconsistency which marks this branch of criminal
law it was admitted that the spontaneous testimony of a man
of good character could outweigh that of a disreputable person
under torment.<a id="FNanchor_1727_1727" href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a> Witnesses, however, could not be tortured
more than three times;<a id="FNanchor_1728_1728" href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> and it was a question mooted
between jurists whether their evidence thus given required,
like the confession of an accused person, to be subsequently
ratified by them.<a id="FNanchor_1729_1729" href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> A reminiscence of Roman law, moreover,
is visible in the rule that no witness could be tortured against
his kindred to the seventh degree, nor against his near connections
by marriage, his feudal superiors, or other similar persons.<a id="FNanchor_1730_1730" href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a></p>

<p>There doubtless was good reason underlying the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
rule, universally followed by modern legists, that, whenever
several parties were on trial under the same accusation, the
torturer should commence with the weakest and tenderest, for
thus it was expected that a confession could soonest be extracted;
but this eager determination to secure conviction
gave rise to a refinement of cruelty in the prescription that if
a husband and wife were arraigned together, the wife should
be tortured first, and in the presence of her husband; and if
a father and son, the son before his father’s face.<a id="FNanchor_1731_1731" href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a></p>

<p>Grillandus, who seems to have been an unusually humane
judge, describes five degrees of torture, using as a standard
the favorite strappado. The first is purely mental—stripping
the prisoner and tying his hands behind him to the rope, but
not hurting him. This can be used when there is no evidence,
and he tells us he had found it very efficacious, especially
with the timid and infirm. The other grades are indicated in
accordance with the strength of the proof and the heinousness
of the crime. The second is hoisting the accused and letting
him hang for the space of an Ave or a Pater Noster, or even a
Miserere, but not elevating him and letting him fall with
a jerk. In the third grade this suspension is prolonged. In
the fourth he is allowed to hang for a time varying from a
quarter of an hour to an hour, according to the crime and the
evidence, and he is jerked two or three times. In the fifth
and severest form a weight is attached to his feet and he is
repeatedly jerked. This Grillandus describes as terrible; the
whole body is torn, the limbs are ready to part from the trunk,
and death itself is preferable. It should only, he says, be
used in the gravest crimes, such as heresy or treason, but we
have already seen that it was mild in comparison with many
inflictions habitually employed.<a id="FNanchor_1732_1732" href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span></p>

<p>Some facilities for defence were allowed to the accused, but
in practice they were almost hopelessly slender. He was
permitted to employ counsel, and if unable to do so, it was
the duty of the judge to look up testimony for the defence.<a id="FNanchor_1733_1733" href="#Footnote_1733_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a>
After all the adverse testimony had been taken, and the
prisoner had been interrogated, he could ask to see a copy of
the proceedings, in order to frame a defence; but the request
could be refused, in which case, the judge was bound to sift
the evidence himself, and to investigate the probabilities of
innocence or guilt. Von Rosbach states that judges were not
in the habit of granting the request, though no authority justified
them in the refusal;<a id="FNanchor_1734_1734" href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> and half a century later this is
confirmed by Bernhardi, who gives as a reason that by withholding
the proceedings from the accused they saved themselves
trouble.<a id="FNanchor_1735_1735" href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a> The right of the accused to see the evidence
adduced against him was still an open question so
recently as 1742, for Goetz deems it necessary to argue at
some length to prove it.<a id="FNanchor_1736_1736" href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> The recognized tendency of such a
system to result in an unfavorable conclusion is shown by
Zanger’s elaborate instructions on this point, and his warning
that, however justifiable torture may seem, it ought not to be
resorted to without at least looking at the evidence which may
be attainable in favor of innocence;<a id="FNanchor_1737_1737" href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> while von Rosbach
characterizes as the greatest fault of the tribunals of his day,
their neglect to obtain and consider testimony for the accused
as well as against him.<a id="FNanchor_1738_1738" href="#Footnote_1738_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> Indeed, when the public interest
was deemed to require it, all safeguards were withdrawn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
the prisoner, as when, in 1719 in Saxony, a mandate was
issued declaring that in cases of thieves and robbers no defence
or exceptions or delays were to be admitted.<a id="FNanchor_1739_1739" href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> In some
special and extraordinary cases, the judge might allow the
accused to be confronted with the accuser, but this was so
contrary to the secrecy required by the inquisitorial system,
that he was cautioned that it was a very unusual course, and
one not lightly to be allowed, as it was odious, unnecessary,
and not pertinent to the trial.<a id="FNanchor_1740_1740" href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a></p>

<p>Theoretically, there was a right of appeal against an order
to inflict torture, but this, even when permitted, could usually
avail the accused but little, for the <i>ex parte</i> testimony which
had satisfied the lower judge could, of course, in most instances,
be so presented to the higher court as to insure the
affirmation of the order, and prisoners, in their helplessness,
would doubtless feel that by the attempt to appeal they would
probably only increase the severity of their inevitable sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_1741_1741" href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a>
Moreover, such appeals were ingeniously and effectually
discouraged by subjecting the advocate of the prisoner
to a fine or some extraordinary punishment if the appeal was
pronounced to be frivolous;<a id="FNanchor_1742_1742" href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> and some authorities, among
which was the great name of Carpzovius, denied that in the
inquisitorial process there was any necessity of communicating
to the accused the order to subject him to torture and then
allow him time to appeal against it if so disposed.<a id="FNanchor_1743_1743" href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a></p>

<p>Slender as were these safeguards in principle, they were reduced
in practice almost to a nullity. That the discretion
lodged in the tribunals was habitually and frightfully abused
is only too evident, when von Rosbach deems it necessary to
reprove, as a common error of the judges of his time, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
idea that the use of torture was a matter altogether dependent
upon their pleasure, “as though nature had created the
bodies of prisoners for them to lacerate at will.”<a id="FNanchor_1744_1744" href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> Thus it
was an acknowledged rule that when guilt could be satisfactorily
proved by witnesses, torture was not admissible;<a id="FNanchor_1745_1745" href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a>
yet Damhouder feels it necessary to condemn the practice of
some judges, who, after conviction by sufficient evidence,
were in the habit of torturing the convict, and boasted that
they never pronounced sentence of death without having first
extorted a confession.<a id="FNanchor_1746_1746" href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> Moreover, the practice was continued
which we have seen habitual in the Châtelet of Paris in the
fourteenth century, whereby, after a man had been duly convicted
of a capital crime, he was tortured to extract confessions
of any other offences of which he might be guilty;<a id="FNanchor_1747_1747" href="#Footnote_1747_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a> and as
late as 1764, Beccaria lifts his voice against it as a still existing
abuse, which he well qualifies as senseless curiosity, impertinent
in the wantonness of its cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_1748_1748" href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a> Martin Bernhardi, writing
in 1705, asserts that this torture after confession and conviction
was also resorted to in order to prevent the convict from
appealing from the sentence.<a id="FNanchor_1749_1749" href="#Footnote_1749_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> So, although a man who freely
confessed a crime could not be tortured, according to the
general principle of the law, still, if in his confession he ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>duced
mitigating circumstances, he could be tortured in order
to force him to withdraw them;<a id="FNanchor_1750_1750" href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> and, moreover, if he were
suspected of having accomplices and refused to name them,
he could be tortured as in the <i>question préalable</i> of the French
courts.<a id="FNanchor_1751_1751" href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> Yet the accusation thus obtained was held to be of
so little value that it only warranted the arrest of the parties
incriminated, who could not legally be tortured without
further evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1752_1752" href="#Footnote_1752_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a> In the face of all this it seems like jesting
mockery to find these grim legists tenderly suggesting that the
prisoner should be tortured only in the morning lest his health
should suffer by subjecting him to the question after a full
meal.<a id="FNanchor_1753_1753" href="#Footnote_1753_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a></p>

<p>If the practice of the criminal courts had been devised with
the purpose of working injustice under the sacred name of law
it could scarce have been different. Even the inalienable privilege
of being heard in his defence was habitually refused to the
accused by many tribunals, which proceeded at once to torture
after hearing the adverse evidence, a refinement of cruelty and
injustice which called forth labored arguments by von Rosbach
and Simancas to prove its impropriety, thus showing it to be
widely practised.<a id="FNanchor_1754_1754" href="#Footnote_1754_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> In the same way, the right to appeal from
an order to torture was evaded by judges, who sent the prisoner
to the rack without a preliminary formal order, thus depriving
him of the opportunity of appealing.<a id="FNanchor_1755_1755" href="#Footnote_1755_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> Indeed, in time it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
admitted by many jurists that the judge at his pleasure could
refuse to allow an appeal; and that in no case was he to wait
more than ten days for the decision of the superior tribunal.<a id="FNanchor_1756_1756" href="#Footnote_1756_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a></p>

<p>The frequency with which torture was used is manifested
in the low rate which was paid for its application. In the
municipal accounts of Valenciennes, between 1538 and 1573,
the legal fee paid to the executioner for each torturing of a
prisoner is only two sous and a half, while he is allowed the
same sum for the white gloves worn at an execution, and ten
sous are given him for such light jobs as piercing the tongue.<a id="FNanchor_1757_1757" href="#Footnote_1757_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a></p>

<p>With all this hideous accumulation of cruelty which shrank
from nothing in the effort to wring a confession from the
wretched victim, that confession, when thus so dearly obtained,
was estimated at its true worthlessness. It was insufficient
for conviction unless confirmed by the accused in a
subsequent examination beyond the confines of the torture-chamber,
at an interval of from one to three days.<a id="FNanchor_1758_1758" href="#Footnote_1758_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a> This
confirmation was by no means universal, and the treatment of
cases of retracted confession was the subject of much debate.
Bodin, in 1579, complains that witches sometimes denied what
they had confessed under torture, and that the puzzled judge
was then obliged to release them.<a id="FNanchor_1759_1759" href="#Footnote_1759_1759" class="fnanchor">1759</a> Such a result, however, was
so totally at variance with the determination to obtain a conviction
which marks the criminal jurisprudence of the period
that it was not likely to be submitted to with patience. Accordingly
the general practice was that, if the confession was
retracted, the accused was again tortured, when a second
confession and retraction made an exceedingly awkward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
dilemma for the subtle jurisconsults. They agreed that he
should not be allowed to escape after giving so much trouble.
Some advocated the regular punishment of his crime, others
demanded for him an extraordinary penalty; some, again,
were in favor of incarcerating him;<a id="FNanchor_1760_1760" href="#Footnote_1760_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a> others assumed that he
should be tortured a third time, when a confession, followed
as before by a recantation, released him from further torment,
for the admirable reason that nature and justice alike abhorred
infinity.<a id="FNanchor_1761_1761" href="#Footnote_1761_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a> This was too metaphysical for some jurists, who
referred the whole question to the discretion of the judge,
with power to prolong the series of alternate confession and
retraction indefinitely, acting doubtless on the theory that
most prisoners were like the scamp spoken of by Ippolito dei
Marsigli, who, after repeated tortures and revocations, when
asked by the judge why he retracted his confession so often,
replied that he would rather be tortured a thousand times in
the arms than once in the neck, for he could easily find a
doctor to set his arm but never one to set his neck.<a id="FNanchor_1762_1762" href="#Footnote_1762_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> The
magistrates in some places were in the habit of imprisoning
or banishing such persons, thus punishing them without conviction,
and inflicting a penalty unsuited to the crime of
which they were accused.<a id="FNanchor_1763_1763" href="#Footnote_1763_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> Others solved the knotty problem
by judiciously advising that in the uncertainty of doubt as to
his guilt, the prisoner should be soundly scourged and turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
loose, after taking an oath not to bring an action for false
imprisonment against his tormentors;<a id="FNanchor_1764_1764" href="#Footnote_1764_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a> but, according to some
authorities, this kind of oath, or <i>urpheda</i> as it was called, was
of no legal value.<a id="FNanchor_1765_1765" href="#Footnote_1765_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> Towards the end of the torture system,
however, the more humane though not very logical doctrine
prevailed in Germany that a retraction absolved the accused,
unless new and different evidence was brought forward, and
this had to be stronger and clearer than before, for the presumption
of innocence was now with the accused, the torture
having purged him of former suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_1766_1766" href="#Footnote_1766_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a></p>

<p>This necessity of repeating a confession after torture gave
rise to another question which caused considerable difference
of opinion among doctors, namely, whether witnesses who were
tortured had to confirm their evidence subsequently, and
whether they, in case of retraction or the presentation of fresh
evidence, could be tortured repeatedly. As usual in doubts
respecting torture, the weight of authority was in favor of its
most liberal use.<a id="FNanchor_1767_1767" href="#Footnote_1767_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a></p>

<p>There were other curious inconsistencies in the system which
manifest still more clearly the real estimate placed on confessions
under torture. If the torture had been inflicted by an
over-zealous judge without proper preliminary evidence, confession
amounted legally to nothing, even though proofs were
subsequently discovered.<a id="FNanchor_1768_1768" href="#Footnote_1768_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> If, on the other hand, absolute and
incontrovertible proof of guilt were had, and the over-zealous
judge tortured in surplusage without extracting a confession,
there arose another of the knotty points to which the torture
system inevitably tended and about which jurisconsults dif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>fered.
Some held that he was to be absolved, because torture
purged him of all the evidence against him; others argued
that he was to be punished with the full penalty of his crime,
because the torture was illegal and therefore null and void;
others again took a middle course and decided that he was to
be visited, not with the penalty of his crime, but with something
else, at the discretion of his judge.<a id="FNanchor_1769_1769" href="#Footnote_1769_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> According to law,
indeed, torture without confession was a full acquittal; but
here, again, practice intervened to destroy what little humanity
was admitted by jurists, and the accused under such circumstances
was still held suspect, and was liable at any moment
to be tried again for the same offence.<a id="FNanchor_1770_1770" href="#Footnote_1770_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> Indeed, at a comparatively
early period after the introduction of torture, we
are told that if the accused endured it without confession he
was to be kept in prison to see whether new evidence might
not turn up: if none came, then the judge was to assign him
a reasonable delay for his defence; he was regularly tried,
when if convicted he was punished; if not he was discharged.<a id="FNanchor_1771_1771" href="#Footnote_1771_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a>
If, again, a man and woman were tortured on an accusation
of adultery committed with each other, and if one confessed
while the other did not, both were acquitted according to some
authorities, while others held that the one who confessed should
receive some punishment different from that provided for the
crime, while the accomplice was to be discharged on taking a
purgatorial oath.<a id="FNanchor_1772_1772" href="#Footnote_1772_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> Nothing more contradictory and illogical
can well be imagined, and, as if to crown the absurdity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
whole, torture after conviction was allowed in order to prevent
appeals; and if the unfortunate, at the place of execution,
chanced to assert his innocence, he was often hurried
from the scaffold to the rack in obedience to the theory that
the confession must remain unretracted;<a id="FNanchor_1773_1773" href="#Footnote_1773_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> though, if the judge
had taken the precaution to have the prisoner’s ratification of
his confession duly certified to by a notary and witnesses, this
trouble might be avoided, and the culprit be promptly executed
in spite of his retraction.<a id="FNanchor_1774_1774" href="#Footnote_1774_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> One can scarce repress a
grim smile at finding that this series of horrors had pious
defenders who urged that a merciful consideration for the
offender’s soul required that he should be brought to confess
his iniquities in order to secure his eternal salvation.<a id="FNanchor_1775_1775" href="#Footnote_1775_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a> It was
a minor, yet none the less a flagrant injustice, that when a
man had endured the torture without confession, and was
therefore discharged as innocent, he or his heirs were obliged
to defray the whole expenses of his prosecution.<a id="FNanchor_1776_1776" href="#Footnote_1776_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a></p>

<p>The atrocity of this whole system of so-called criminal
justice is forcibly described by the honest indignation of
Augustin Nicolas, who, in his judicial capacity under Louis
XIV., had ample opportunities of observing its practical
working and results.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span> “The strappado, so common in Italy,
and which yet is forbidden under the Roman law ... the
vigils of Spain, which oblige a man to support himself by
sheer muscular effort for seven hours, to avoid sitting on a
pointed iron, which pierces him with insufferable pain; the
vigils of Florence, or of Marsiglio, which have been described
above; our iron stools heated to redness, on which we place
poor half-witted women accused of witchcraft, exhausted by
frightful imprisonment, rotting from their dark and filthy
dungeons, loaded with chains, fleshless, and half dead; and
we pretend that the human frame can resist these devilish
practices, and that the confessions which our wretched victims
make of everything that may be charged against them
are true.”<a id="FNanchor_1777_1777" href="#Footnote_1777_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a> Under such a scheme of jurisprudence, it is easy
to understand and appreciate the case of the unfortunate
peasant, sentenced for witchcraft, who, in his dying confession
to the priest, admitted that he was a sorcerer, and
humbly welcomed death as the fitting retribution for the unpardonable
crimes of which he had been found guilty, but
pitifully inquired of the shuddering confessor whether one
could not be a sorcerer without knowing it.<a id="FNanchor_1778_1778" href="#Footnote_1778_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a></p>

<p>If anything were wanting to show how completely the inquisitorial
process turned all the chances against the accused,
it is to be found in the quaint advice given by Damhouder.
He counsels the prisoner, when required to plead, to prevent
his judge from taking advantage of any adverse points that
might occur, as, for instance, in a charge of homicide to
assert his innocence, but to add that, if he were proved to
have committed the crime, he then declares it to have been
done in self-defence.<a id="FNanchor_1779_1779" href="#Footnote_1779_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen above how great was the part of the Inquisition
in introducing and moulding the whole system of torture
on the ruins of the feudal law. Even so, in the reconstruction
of European jurisprudence, during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, the ardor of the inquisitorial proceedings
against witchcraft, and the panic on the subject which
long pervaded Christendom, had a powerful influence in
familiarizing the minds of men with the use of torture as a
necessary instrument of justice, and in authorizing its employment
to an extent which now is almost inconceivable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span></p>

<p>From a very early period, torture was recognized as indispensable
in all trials for sorcery and magic. In 358, an
edict of Constantius decreed that no dignity of birth or station
should protect those accused of such offences from its
application in the severest form.<a id="FNanchor_1780_1780" href="#Footnote_1780_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a> How universal its employment
thus became is evident from a canon of the council of
Merida, in 666, declaring that priests, when sick, sometimes
accused the slaves of their churches of bewitching them, and
impiously tortured them against all ecclesiastical rules.<a id="FNanchor_1781_1781" href="#Footnote_1781_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a> It
was, therefore, natural that all such crimes should be regarded
as peculiarly subjecting all suspected of them to the last extremity
of torture, and its use in the trials of witches and
sorcerers came to be regarded as indispensable.</p>

<p>The necessity which all men felt that these crimes should
be extirpated with merciless severity, and the impalpable
nature of the testimony on which the tribunals had mostly
to depend, added to this traditional belief in the fitness of
torture. Witchcraft was considered as peculiarly difficult of
proof, and torture consequently became an unfailing resource
to the puzzled tribunal, although every legal safeguard was
refused to the wretched criminal, and the widest latitude of
evidence was allowed. Bodin expressly declares that in so
fearful a crime no rules of procedure are to be observed.<a id="FNanchor_1782_1782" href="#Footnote_1782_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a>
Sons were admitted to testify against their fathers, and young
girls were regarded as the best of witnesses against their
mothers; the disrepute of a witness was no bar to the reception
of his testimony, and even children of irresponsible age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
were allowed to swear before they rightly knew the nature of
the oath on which hung the life of a parent. Boguet, who
presided over a tribunal in Franche Comté, in stating this
rule relates a most pathetic case of his own in which a man
named Guillaume Vuillermoz was convicted on the testimony
of his son, aged twelve, and the hardened nerves of the judge
were wrung at the despair of the unhappy prisoner on being
confronted with his child, who persisted in his story with a
callousness only to be explained by the will of God, who
stifled in him all natural affection in order to bring to condign
punishment this most hideous offence.<a id="FNanchor_1783_1783" href="#Footnote_1783_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a> Louïse prints the
records of a trial in 1662, wherein Philippe Polus was condemned
on the evidence of his daughter, a child in her ninth
year. There seems to have been no other proof against him,
and according to her own testimony the girl had been a
sorceress since her fourth year.<a id="FNanchor_1784_1784" href="#Footnote_1784_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a> Even advocates and counsel
could be forced to give evidence against their clients.<a id="FNanchor_1785_1785" href="#Footnote_1785_1785" class="fnanchor">1785</a> Notwithstanding
the ample resources thus afforded for conviction,
Jacob Rickius, who, as a magistrate during an epidemic of
witchcraft, at the close of the sixteenth century, had the
fullest practical experience on the subject, complains that no
reliance could be placed on legal witnesses to produce conviction;<a id="FNanchor_1786_1786" href="#Footnote_1786_1786" class="fnanchor">1786</a>
and Del Rio only expresses the general opinion
when he avers that torture is to be more readily resorted to in
witchcraft than in other crimes, in consequence of the extreme
difficulty of its proof.<a id="FNanchor_1787_1787" href="#Footnote_1787_1787" class="fnanchor">1787</a></p>

<p>Even the widespread belief that Satan aided his worshippers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
in their extremity by rendering them insensible to pain did
not serve to relax the efforts of the extirpators of witchcraft,
though they could hardly avoid the conclusion that they were
punishing only the innocent, and allowing the guilty to escape.
Boguet, indeed, seems to recognize this practical inconsistency,
and, though it is permissible to use torture even during church
festivals, he advises the judge not to have recourse to it because
of its inutility.<a id="FNanchor_1788_1788" href="#Footnote_1788_1788" class="fnanchor">1788</a> How little his advice was heeded, and
how little the courts deemed themselves able to dispense with
torture, is shown in the charter of Hainault of 1619 where in
these cases the tribunal is authorized to employ it to ascertain
the truth of the charge, or to discover accomplices, or <i>for any
other purpose</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1789_1789" href="#Footnote_1789_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a> In this dilemma, various means were adopted
to circumvent the arch enemy, of which the one most generally
resorted to was that of shaving the whole person carefully before
applying the torture,<a id="FNanchor_1790_1790" href="#Footnote_1790_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a> a process which served as an excuse for
the most indecent outrages upon female prisoners. Yet notwithstanding
all the precautions of the most experienced exorcists,
we find in the bloody farce of Urbain Grandier that
the fiercest torments left him in capital spirits and good humor.<a id="FNanchor_1791_1791" href="#Footnote_1791_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a>
Damhouder relates at much length a curious case which
occurred under his own eyes while member of the council of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
Bruges, when he assisted at the torture of a reputed witch who
had exercised her power only in good works. During three
examinations, she bore the severest torture without shrinking,
sometimes sleeping and sometimes defiantly snapping her
fingers at the judges. At length, during the process of shaving,
a slip of parchment covered with cabalistic characters
was found concealed in her person, and on its removal she
was speedily brought to acknowledge her pact with the Evil
One.<a id="FNanchor_1792_1792" href="#Footnote_1792_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a> The tender-hearted Rickius was so convinced of this
source of uncertainty that he was accustomed to administer
the cold-water ordeal to all the miserable old women brought
before him on such charges, but he is careful to inform us
that this was only preparatory proof, to enable him with a
safer conscience to torture those who were so ill-advised as to
float instead of sinking.<a id="FNanchor_1793_1793" href="#Footnote_1793_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a> Grillandus tells us that he had met
with cases in which the insensibility to the severest tortures
was so complete that only magic arts could explain it; the
patient seemed to be supported in the air, or to be in a profound
stupor, and he mentions some of the formulas which
were employed for the purpose. In one case at Rome a
notorious thief suspected of a large robbery came to him
voluntarily and said he wanted to purge himself of the rumors
against him. He was tortured repeatedly in various ways;
when the operation began he muttered something and fell into
a stupor in which he was absolutely insensible. After exhausting
his ingenuity, Grillandus had to discharge him. In
another case the formula “Quemadmodum lac beatæ,” etc.,
produced the same effect.<a id="FNanchor_1794_1794" href="#Footnote_1794_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span></p>

<p>From the time when the Cappadocians of old were said to
harden their children with torture in order that they might
profitably follow the profession of false witnesses, there existed
so general a belief among experienced men that criminals of
all kinds had secrets with which to deaden sensibility to torture
that it is not improbable that the unfortunates occasionally
were able to strengthen their endurance with some
anæsthetic. Boguet complains that in modern times torture
had become almost useless not only with sorcerers but with
criminals in general, and Damhouder asserts that professional
malefactors were in the habit of torturing each other in order
to be hardened when brought to justice, in consequence of
which he advises the judge to inquire into the antecedents of
prisoners, in order to proportion the severity of the torture to
the necessities of the case.<a id="FNanchor_1795_1795" href="#Footnote_1795_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a></p>

<p>When the concentrated energies of these ingenious and
determined law dispensers failed to extort by such means a
confession from the wretched clowns and gossips thus placed
at their mercy, they were even yet not wholly at fault. The
primitive teachings of the Inquisition of the thirteenth century
were not yet obsolete; they were instructed to treat the prisoner
kindly, and to introduce into his dungeon some prepossessing
agent who should make friends with him and induce
him to confess what was wanted of him, promising to influence
the judge to pardon, when at that moment the judge is to enter
the cell and to promise grace, with the mental reservation that
his grace should be shown to the community and not to the
prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_1796_1796" href="#Footnote_1796_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a> Or, still following the ancient traditions, spies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
to be confined with him, who should profess to be likewise
sorcerers and thus lead him to incriminate himself, or else the
unhappy wretch was to be told that his associate prisoners had
borne testimony against him, in order to induce him to revenge
himself by turning witness against them.<a id="FNanchor_1797_1797" href="#Footnote_1797_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a> Boguet, indeed, does
not consider it correct to mislead the accused with promises of
pardon, and though it was generally approved by legists, he
decides against it.<a id="FNanchor_1798_1798" href="#Footnote_1798_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> Simancas also considers such artifices to
be illegal, and that a confession thus procured could be retracted.<a id="FNanchor_1799_1799" href="#Footnote_1799_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a>
Del Rio, on the other hand, while loftily condemning
the outspoken trickery recommended by Sprenger and
Bodin, proceeds to draw a careful distinction between <i>dolum
bonum</i> and <i>dolum malum</i>. He forbids absolute lying, but advises
equivocation and ambiguous promises, and then, if the
prisoner is deceived, he has only himself to thank for it.<a id="FNanchor_1800_1800" href="#Footnote_1800_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a> In
fact, these men conceived that they were engaged in a direct
and personal struggle with the Evil One, and that Satan could
only be overcome with his own arts.</p>

<p>When the law thus pitilessly turned all the chances against
the victim, it is easy to understand that few escaped. In the
existing condition of popular frenzy on the subject, there was
no one but could feel that he might at any moment be brought
under accusation by personal enemies or by unfortunates compelled
on the rack to declare the names of all whom they might
have seen congregated at the witches’ sabbat. We can thus
readily comprehend the feelings of those who, living under
such uncertainties, coolly and deliberately made up their minds
in advance that, if chance should expose them to suspicion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
they would at once admit everything that the inquisitors might
desire of them, preferring a speedy death to one more lingering
and scarcely less certain.<a id="FNanchor_1801_1801" href="#Footnote_1801_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> The evil fostered with such
careful exaggeration grew to so great proportions that Father
Tanner speaks of the multitude of witches who were daily convicted
through torture;<a id="FNanchor_1802_1802" href="#Footnote_1802_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> and that this was no mere form of
speech is evident when one judge, in a treatise on the subject,
boasted of his zeal and experience in having dispatched within
his single district nine hundred wretches in the space of fifteen
years, and another trustworthy authority relates with pride that
in the diocese of Como alone as many as a thousand had been
burnt in a twelvemonth, while the annual average was over a
hundred.<a id="FNanchor_1803_1803" href="#Footnote_1803_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a></p>

<p>Were it not for the steady patronage bestowed on the system
by the Church, it would seem strange that torture should invade
the quiet and holy retirement of the cloister. Its use,
however, in monasteries was, if possible, even more arbitrary
than in secular tribunals. Monks and nuns were exempt from
the jurisdiction of the civil authorities, and were bound by
vows of blind obedience to their superiors. The head of each
convent thus was an autocrat, and when investigating the delinquencies
of any of his flock he was subjected to no limitations.
Not only could he order the accused to be tortured at
will, but the witnesses, whether male or female, were liable to
the same treatment, with the exception that in the case of nuns
it was recommended that the tortures employed should not be
indecent or too severe for the fragility of the sex. As elsewhere,
it was customary to commence the torment with the
weakest of the witnesses or criminals.<a id="FNanchor_1804_1804" href="#Footnote_1804_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a></p>

<small>ENGLAND AND THE NORTHERN RACES.</small></h3>


<p>In this long history of legalized cruelty and wrong the races
of northern Europe are mostly exceptional. Yet it is somewhat
remarkable that the first regular mediæval code in which torture
is admitted as a means of investigation is the one of all
others in which it would be least expected. The earliest extant
law of Iceland, the Grágás, which dates from 1119, has
one or two indications of its existence which are interesting as
being purely autochthonic and in no sense derivable, as in the
rest of Europe, from the Roman law. The character of the
people, indeed, and of their institutions would seem to be peculiarly
incompatible with the use of torture, for almost all cases
were submitted to inquests or juries of the vicinage, and, when
this was unsuitable, resort was had to the ordeal. The indigenous
origin of the custom, however, is shown by the fact that
while it was used in but few matters, the most prominent class
subjected to it was that of pregnant women, who have elsewhere
been spared by the common consent of even the most
pitiless legislators. An unmarried woman with child, who
refused to name her seducer, could be forced to do so by
moderate torments which should not break or discolor the
skin.<a id="FNanchor_1805_1805" href="#Footnote_1805_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a> The object of this was to enable the family to obtain
the fine from the seducer, and to save themselves from the
expense of supporting the child. When the mother confessed,
however, additional evidence was required to convict the putative
father. When the inhabitants of a district, also, refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
to deliver up a man claimed as an outlaw by another district,
they were bound to torture him to ascertain the truth of the
charge<a id="FNanchor_1806_1806" href="#Footnote_1806_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a>—a provision doubtless explicable by the important
part occupied by outlawry in all the schemes of Scandinavian
legislation. These are the only instances in which it is permitted,
while its occasional abuse is shown by a section providing
punishment for its illegal employment.<a id="FNanchor_1807_1807" href="#Footnote_1807_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> Slaves, moreover,
under the Icelandic, as under other codes, had no protection
at law, and were at the mercy of their masters.<a id="FNanchor_1808_1808" href="#Footnote_1808_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> These few
indications of the liability of freemen, however, disappear about
the time when the rest of Europe was commencing to adopt the
use of torture. In the <i>Jarnsida</i>, or code compiled for Iceland
by Hako Hakonsen of Norway, in 1258, there is no allusion
whatever to its use.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian nations, as a whole, did not admit torture
into their systems of jurisprudence. The institution of
the jury in various forms was common to all, and where proof
upon open trial was deficient, they allowed, until a comparatively
recent date, the accused to clear himself by sacramental
purgation. Thus, in the Danish laws of Waldemar II., to
which the date of 1240 is generally assigned, there is a species
of permanent jury, <i>sandemend</i>, as well as a temporary one,
<i>nefninge</i>, and torture seems to have formed no part of judicial
proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_1809_1809" href="#Footnote_1809_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a> This code was in force until 1683, when that
of Christiern V. was promulgated. It is probable that the employment
of torture may have crept in from Germany, without
being regularly sanctioned, for we find Christiern forbidding
its use except in cases of high treason, where the magnitude of
the offence seems to him to justify the infraction of the general
rule. He, however, encouraged one of its greatest abuses in
permitting it on criminals condemned to death.<a id="FNanchor_1810_1810" href="#Footnote_1810_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span></p>

<p>Among the kindred Frisians the tendency was the same.
Their code of 1323 is a faithful transcript of the primitive
Barbarian jurisprudence. It contains no allusions to torture,
and as all crimes, except theft, were still compounded for with
<i>wer-gilds</i>, it may reasonably be assumed that the extortion of
confession was not recognized as a judicial expedient.<a id="FNanchor_1811_1811" href="#Footnote_1811_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a></p>

<p>So, in Sweden, the code of Raguald, compiled in 1441,
and in force until 1614, during a period in which torture
flourished in almost every European state, has no place for
it. Trials are conducted before twelve <i>nempdarii</i>, or jurymen,
and in doubtful cases the accused is directed to clear
himself by oath or by conjurators. For atrocious crimes the
punishments are severe, such as the wheel or the stake, but
inflictions like these are reserved for the condemned.<a id="FNanchor_1812_1812" href="#Footnote_1812_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> Into
these distant regions the Roman jurisprudence penetrated
slowly, and the jury trial was an elastic institution which
adapted itself to all cases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the same causes may be attributed the absence of torture
from the Common Law of England. In common with the
other Barbarian races, the Anglo-Saxons solved all doubtful
questions by the ordeal and wager of law, and in the collection
known as the laws of Henry I. a principle is laid down which
is incompatible with the whole theory of torture, whether used
to extract confession or evidence. A confession obtained by
fear or fraud is pronounced invalid, and no one who has
confessed his own crime is to be believed with respect to that
of another.<a id="FNanchor_1813_1813" href="#Footnote_1813_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a> Such a principle, combined with the gradual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
growth of the trial by jury, doubtless preserved the law from
the contamination of inquisitorial procedure, though, as we
have seen, torture was extensively employed for purposes of
extortion by marauders and lawless nobles during periods of
civil commotion. Glanville makes no allusion to it, and
though Bracton shows a wide acquaintance with the revived
Roman jurisprudence, and makes extensive use of it in all
matters where it could be advantageously harmonized with
existing institutions, he is careful to abstain from introducing
torture into criminal procedure.<a id="FNanchor_1814_1814" href="#Footnote_1814_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a> A clause in Magna Charta,
indeed, has been held by high authority to inhibit the employment
of torture, but it has no direct allusion to the subject,
which was not a living question at the time, and was probably
not thought of by any of the parties to that transaction.<a id="FNanchor_1815_1815" href="#Footnote_1815_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
fact, the whole spirit of English law was irreconcilable with
the fundamental principles of the inquisitorial process. When
the accused was brought before court, he was, it is true, required
to appear ungirdled, without boots, or cap, or cloak,
to show his humility, but it is expressly directed that he shall
not be chained, lest his fetters should embarrass his self-possession
in his defence, and he was not to be forced in any way
to state anything but of his own free will.<a id="FNanchor_1816_1816" href="#Footnote_1816_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> Men who could
frame legal maxims so honorable to their sense of justice and
so far in advance of the received notions of their age could
evidently have nothing in common with the principles which
placed the main reliance of the law on confession to be wrung
from the lips of an unfortunate wretch who was systematically
deprived of all support and assistance. To do so, in fact, is
classed with homicide, by a legal writer of the period;<a id="FNanchor_1817_1817" href="#Footnote_1817_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a> but
that it was occasionally practised is shown by his giving a form
for the appeal of homicide against judges guilty of it.<a id="FNanchor_1818_1818" href="#Footnote_1818_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a></p>

<p>Under the common law, therefore, torture had properly no
existence in England, and in spite of occasional efforts on
the part of the Plantagenets<a id="FNanchor_1819_1819" href="#Footnote_1819_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a> the character of the national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
institutions kept at bay the absorbing and centralizing influences
of the Roman law.<a id="FNanchor_1820_1820" href="#Footnote_1820_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> Yet their wide acceptance in
France, and their attractiveness to those who desired to wield
absolute authority, gradually accustomed the crown and the
crown lawyers to the idea that torture could be administered
by order of the sovereign. Sir John Fortescue, who was
Lord Chancellor under Henry VI., inveighs at great length
against the French law for its cruel procedures, and with
much satisfaction contrasts it with the English practice,<a id="FNanchor_1821_1821" href="#Footnote_1821_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> and
yet he does not deny that torture was occasionally used in
England. Indeed, his fervent arguments against the system,
addressed to Prince Edward, indicate an anxiety to combat
and resist the spread of civil law doctrines on the subject,
which doubtless were favored by the influence of Margaret
of Anjou. An instance of its application in 1468 has, in fact,
been recorded, which resulted in the execution of Sir Thomas
Coke, Lord Mayor of London;<a id="FNanchor_1822_1822" href="#Footnote_1822_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a> and in 1485, Innocent VIII.
remonstrated with Henry VII. respecting some proceedings
against ecclesiastics who were scourged, tortured, and hanged.<a id="FNanchor_1823_1823" href="#Footnote_1823_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a></p>

<p>Under Henry VIII. and his children, the power of the
crown was largely extended, and the doctrine became fashionable
that, though under the law no one could be tortured for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
confession or evidence, yet outside and above the law the
royal prerogative was supreme, and that a warrant from the
King in Privy Council fully justified the use of the rack and
the introduction of the secret inquisitorial process, with all
its attendant cruelty and injustice. It is difficult to conceive
the subserviency which could reconcile men, bred in the open
and manly justice of the common law, to a system so subversive
of all the principles in which they had been trained.
Yet the loftiest names of the profession were concerned in
transactions which they knew to be in contravention of the
laws of the land.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Smith, one of the ornaments of the Elizabethan
bar, condemned the practice as not only illegal, but illogical.
“Torment or question, which is used by order of the civile
law and custome of other countries, ... is not used
in England.... The nature of Englishmen is to neglect
death, to abide no torment; and therefore hee will confesse
rather to have done anything, yea, to have killed his owne
father, than to suffer torment.” And yet, a few years later,
we find the same Sir Thomas writing to Lord Burghley, in
1571, respecting two miserable wretches whom he was engaged
in racking under a warrant from Queen Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_1824_1824" href="#Footnote_1824_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a></p>

<p>In like manner, Sir Edward Coke, in his Institutes, declares—“So,
as there is no law to warrant tortures in this
land, nor can they be justified by any prescription, being so
lately brought in.” Yet, in 1603, there is a warrant addressed
to Coke and Fleming, as Attorney and Solicitor
General, directing them to apply torture to a servant of Lord
Hundsdon, who had been guilty of some idle speeches respecting
King James, and the resultant confession is in Coke’s
handwriting, showing that he personally superintended the
examination.<a id="FNanchor_1825_1825" href="#Footnote_1825_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span></p>

<p>Coke’s great rival, Lord Bacon, was as subservient as his
contemporaries. In 1619, while Chancellor, we find him
writing to King James concerning a prisoner confined in the
Tower on suspicion of treason—“If it may not be done
otherwise, it is fit Peacock be put to torture. He deserveth
it as well as Peacham did”—Peacham being an unfortunate
parson in whose desk was found a MS. sermon, never preached,
containing some unpalatable reflections on the royal prerogative,
which the prerogative resented by putting him on
the rack.<a id="FNanchor_1826_1826" href="#Footnote_1826_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a></p>

<p>As in other countries, so in England, when torture was
once introduced, it rapidly broke the bounds which the
prudence of the Roman lawgivers had established for it.
Treason was a most elastic crime, as was shown in 1553 by
its serving as an excuse for the torture of one Stonyng, a
prisoner in the Marshalsea, because he had transcribed for the
amusement of his fellow-captives a satirical description of
Philip II., whose marriage with Queen Mary was then under
contemplation.<a id="FNanchor_1827_1827" href="#Footnote_1827_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> But it was not only in cases of high treason
that the royal prerogative was allowed to transgress the limits
of the law. Matters of religion, indeed, in those times of
perennial change, when dynasties depended on dogmas, might
come under the comprehensive head of constructive treason,
and be considered to justify the torture even of women, as in
the instance of Ann Askew in 1546;<a id="FNanchor_1828_1828" href="#Footnote_1828_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a> and of monks guilty of
no other crime than the endeavor to preserve their monasteries
by pretended miracles.<a id="FNanchor_1829_1829" href="#Footnote_1829_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a> Under Elizabeth, engaged in a
death-struggle with Rome, matters became even worse, and
torture was habitually used on the unhappy Catholics who
were thrown into the Tower. As the whole matter was with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>out
the color of law, all legal limitations seem to have been
disregarded. The Jesuit Campion was subjected to the rack
no less than three times with extreme severity, and in the
intervals was made to dispute with Protestant divines.<a id="FNanchor_1830_1830" href="#Footnote_1830_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a>
Having once thus secured its introduction in state trials for
treason, the custom inevitably tended to spread to the sphere
of the most ordinary criminal business. Suspicion of theft,
murder, horse-stealing, embezzlement, and other similar offences
was sufficient to consign the unfortunate accused to the tender
mercies of the rack, the Scavenger’s Daughter,<a id="FNanchor_1831_1831" href="#Footnote_1831_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a> and the
manacles, when the aggrieved person had influence enough to
procure a royal warrant; nor were these proceedings confined
to the secret dungeons of the Tower, for the records show that
torture began to be habitually applied in the Bridewell.
Jardine, however, states that this especially dangerous extension
of the abuse appears to have ceased with the death of
Elizabeth, and that no trace of the torture even of political
prisoners can be found later than the year 1640.<a id="FNanchor_1832_1832" href="#Footnote_1832_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a> The royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
prerogative had begun to be too severely questioned to render
such manifestations of it prudent, and the Great Rebellion
finally settled the constitutional rights of the subject on too
secure a basis for even the time-serving statesmen of the
Restoration to venture on a renewal of the former practice.
Yet how nearly, at one time, it had come to be engrafted on
the law of the land is evident from its being sufficiently recognized
as a legal procedure for persons of noble blood to claim
immunity from it, and for the judges to admit that claim as a
special privilege. In the Countess of Shrewsbury’s case, the
judges, among whom was Sir Edward Coke, declared that
there was a “privilege which the law gives for the honor and
reverence of the nobility, that their bodies are not subject to
torture <i>in causa criminis læsæ majestatis</i>,” and no instance
is on record to disprove the assertion.<a id="FNanchor_1833_1833" href="#Footnote_1833_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a></p>

<p>In one class of offences, however, torture was frequently used
to a later date, and without requiring the royal intervention.
As on the Continent, sorcery and witchcraft were regarded as
crimes of such peculiar atrocity, and the dread they excited
was so universal and intense, that those accused of them were
practically placed beyond the pale of the law, and no means
were considered too severe to secure the conviction which in
many cases could only be obtained by confession. We have
seen that among the refinements of Italian torture, the deprivation
of sleep for forty hours was considered by the most experienced
authorities on the subject to be second to none in
severity and effectiveness. It neither lacerated the flesh, dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>located
the joints, nor broke the bones, and yet few things
could be conceived as more likely to cloud the intellect, break
down the will, and reduce the prisoner into a frame of mind
in which he would be ready to admit anything that the questions
of his examiners might suggest to him. In English
witch-trials, this method of torture was not infrequently resorted
to, without the limitation of time to which it was
restricted by the more experienced jurists of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1834_1834" href="#Footnote_1834_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a></p>

<p>Another form of torture used in Great Britain, which doubtless
proved exceedingly efficacious, was the “pricking” adopted
to discover the insensible spot, which, according to popular belief,
was one of the invariable signs of a witch. There were
even professional “prickers” who were called in as experts in
the witch-trials, and who thrust long pins into the body of the
accused until some result, either negative or positive, was obtained.<a id="FNanchor_1835_1835" href="#Footnote_1835_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a>
Thus at the prosecution of Janet Barker, in Edinburgh,
in 1643, it is recorded that “she had the usual mark
on the left shoulder, which enabled one James Scober, a skilful
pricker of witches, to find her out by putting a large pin into
it, which she never felt.”<a id="FNanchor_1836_1836" href="#Footnote_1836_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> One witch pricker, named Kincaid,
used to strip his victims, bind them hand and foot, and
then thrust his pins into every part of their bodies, until, exhausted
and rendered speechless by the torture, they failed to
scream, when he would triumphantly proclaim that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
found the witch-mark. Another pricker confessed on the
gallows that he had illegally caused the death of a hundred
and twenty women whom he had thus pricked for witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_1837_1837" href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, torture, as a regular form of judicial investigation,
was of late introduction. In the various codes collected
by Skene, extending from an early period to the commencement
of the fifteenth century, there is no allusion whatever to
it. In the last of these codes, adopted under Robert III. by
the Parliament of Scotland in 1400, the provisions respecting
the wager of battle show that torture would have been superfluous
as a means of supplementing deficient evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1838_1838" href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> The
influence of the Roman law, however, though late in appearing,
was eventually much more deeply felt in Scotland than
in the sister kingdom, and consequently torture at length came
to be regarded as an ordinary resource in doubtful cases. In
the witch persecutions, especially, which in Scotland rivalled
the worst excesses of the Inquisition of Italy and Spain, it was
carried to a pitch of frightful cruelty which far transcended
the limits assigned to it elsewhere. Thus the vigils, which
we have seen consisted simply in keeping the accused awake
for forty hours by the simplest modes, in Scotland were fearfully
aggravated by a witch-bridle, a band of iron fastened
around the face, with four diverging points thrust into the
mouth. With this the accused was secured immovably to a
wall, and cases are on record in which this insupportable torment
was prolonged for five and even for nine days. In other
cases an enormous weight of iron hoops and chains, amounting
to twenty-five or thirty stone, would be accumulated on
the body of the patient.<a id="FNanchor_1839_1839" href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> Indeed, it is difficult to believe that
the accounts which have been preserved to us of these terrible
scenes are not exaggerated. No cruelty is too great for the
conscientious persecutor who believes that he is avenging his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
God, but the limitless capacity of human nature for inflicting
is not complemented by a limitless capacity of endurance on
the part of the victim; and well authenticated as the accounts
of the Scottish witch-trials may be, they seem to transcend the
possibility of human strength.<a id="FNanchor_1840_1840" href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> In another respect these witch-trials
were marked with a peculiar atrocity. Elsewhere, as we
have seen, confession was requisite for condemnation, thus affording
some color of excuse for torture. In Scotland, however,
the testimony of the pricker was sufficient, and torture
thus became a wanton and cruel surplusage, rendered the less
defensible in that the poor wretch who yielded to the torment
and confessed was rewarded by being mercifully strangled before
being burnt, while those who held out under torture were
condemned and burnt alive.<a id="FNanchor_1841_1841" href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a></p>

<p>Torture thus maintained its place in the laws of Scotland
as long as the kingdom preserved the right of self-legislation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
though an attempt seems to have been made to repress it
during the temporary union with England under the Commonwealth.
In 1652, when the English Commissioners for
the administration of justice sat in Edinburgh, among other
criminals brought before them were two witches who had
confessed their guilt before the Kirk. They were the remains
of a party of six, four of whom had died under the
tortures employed to procure confession—such as hanging
by the thumbs tied behind the back, scourging, burning the
feet and head and putting lighted candles into their mouths,
clothing them in hair-cloth soaked in vinegar “to fetch off
the skin,” &amp;c. Another woman was stripped naked, laid on
a cold stone with a hair-cloth over her, and thus kept for
twenty-eight days and nights, being fed on bread and water.
The diarist who records this adds that “The judges are resolved
to inquire into the business, and have appointed the
sheriff, ministers, and tormentors to be found out, and to
have an account of the ground of this cruelty.”<a id="FNanchor_1842_1842" href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> What result
their humane efforts obtained in this particular instance
I have not been able to ascertain, but the legal administration
of torture was not abolished until after the Union, when,
in 1709, the United Parliament made haste, at its second session,
to pass an act for “improving the Union,” by which
it was done away with.<a id="FNanchor_1843_1843" href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a> Yet the spirit which had led to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
abuse could not be repressed by Act of Parliament, and a
case is on record, occurring in 1722, when a poor old woman
in her dotage, condemned to be burnt as a witch, actually
warmed her withered hands at the stake lighted for her destruction,
and mumbled out her gladness at enjoying the unaccustomed
warmth.<a id="FNanchor_1844_1844" href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a></p>

<small>DECLINE OF THE TORTURE SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<p>A system of procedure which entailed results so deplorable
as those which we have seen accompany it everywhere, could
scarcely fail to arouse the opposition of thinking men who
were not swayed by reverence for precedent or carried away by
popular impulses. Accordingly, an occasional voice was raised
in denunciation of the use of torture. Geiler von Kaisersberg,
the most popular preacher of his time in Germany, who died in
1510, endeavored to procure its disuse, as well as to mitigate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
the cruelties practised upon prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_1845_1845" href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> The Spaniard, Juan
Luis Vives, one of the profoundest scholars of the sixteenth
century, condemned it as useless and inhuman.<a id="FNanchor_1846_1846" href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a> The sceptic
of the period, Montaigne, was too cool and clear-headed not
to appreciate the vicious principle on which it was based, and
he did not hesitate to stamp it with his reprobation. “To tell
the truth, it is a means full of uncertainty and danger; what
would we not say, what would we not do to escape suffering
so poignant? whence it happens that when a judge tortures a
prisoner for the purpose of not putting an innocent man to
death, he puts him to death both innocent and tortured....
Are you not unjust when, to save him from being killed, you
do worse than kill him?”<a id="FNanchor_1847_1847" href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> In 1624, the learned Johann Gräfe,
in his <i>Tribunal Reformatum</i>, argued forcibly in favor of
its abolition, having had, it is said, practical experience of
its horrors during his persecution for Arminianism by the
Calvinists of Holland, and his book attracted sufficient attention
to be repeatedly reprinted.<a id="FNanchor_1848_1848" href="#Footnote_1848_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> Friedrich Keller, in 1657,
at the University of Strassburg, presented a well-reasoned
thesis urging its disuse, which was reprinted in 1688, although
the title which he prefixed to it shows that he scarce dared to
assume the responsibility for its unpopular doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_1849_1849" href="#Footnote_1849_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> When
the French Ordonnance of 1670 was in preparation, various
magistrates of the highest character and largest experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
gave it as their fixed opinion that torture was useless, that it
rarely succeeded in eliciting the truth from the accused, and
that it ought to be abolished.<a id="FNanchor_1850_1850" href="#Footnote_1850_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a> Towards the close of the
century, various writers took up the question. The best
known of these was perhaps Augustin Nicolas, who has been
frequently referred to above, and who argued with more zeal
and learning than skill against the whole system, but especially
against it as applied in cases of witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_1851_1851" href="#Footnote_1851_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a> In 1692,
von Boden, in a work alluded to in the preceding pages,
inveighed against its abuses, while admitting its utility in
many classes of crimes. Bayle, not long after, in his Dictionary,
condemned it in his usual indirect and suggestive
manner.<a id="FNanchor_1852_1852" href="#Footnote_1852_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a> In 1705, at the University of Halle, Martin Bernhardi
of Pomerania, a candidate for the doctorate, in his
inaugural thesis, argued with much vigor in favor of abolishing
it, and the dean of the faculty, Christian Thomas, acknowledged
the validity of his reasoning, though expressing doubts
as to the practicability of a sudden reform. Bernhardi states
that in his time it was no longer employed in Holland, and
its disuse in Utrecht he attributes to a case in which a thief
procured the execution, after due torture and confession, of
a shoemaker, against whom he had brought a false charge in
revenge for the refusal of a pair of boots.<a id="FNanchor_1853_1853" href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> His assertion,
however, is too general, for it was not until the formation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
the Republic of the Netherlands, in 1798, that it was formally
abolished.<a id="FNanchor_1854_1854" href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a></p>

<p>These efforts had little effect, but they manifest the progress
of enlightenment, and doubtless paved the way for
change, especially in the Prussian territories. Yet, in 1730,
we find the learned Baron Senckenberg reproducing Zanger’s
treatise, not as an archæological curiosity, but as a practical
text-book for the guidance of lawyers and judges. Meanwhile
the propriety of the system continued to be a subject of discussion
in the schools, with ample expenditure of learning on
both sides.<a id="FNanchor_1855_1855" href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> In 1733, at Leipzig, Moritz August Engel read a
thesis, which called forth much applause, in which he undertook
to defend the use of torture against the dictum of Christian
Thomas nearly thirty years before.<a id="FNanchor_1856_1856" href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a> The argument employed
is based on the theory of the criminal jurisprudence of
the time, in which the guilt of the accused is taken for granted
and the burden thrown upon him of proving himself innocent.
Engel declares that in all well-ordered States torture is rightfully
employed; those who are innocent and are the victims
of suspicious circumstances have only themselves to blame for
their imprudence, and must make allowance for the imperfections
of human reason; and he airily disposes of the injustice
of the system by declaring that the State need not care if an
innocent man is occasionally tortured, for no human ordinance
can be expected to be free from occasional drawbacks. Another
disputant on the same side meets the argument that the differ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>ent
sensibilities of individuals rendered torture uncertain, by
boasting that in the Duchy of Zerbst the executioner had invented
an instrument which would wring a confession out of
the most hardened and robust.<a id="FNanchor_1857_1857" href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> It was shortly after this, however,
that the process of reform began in earnest. Frederic
the Great succeeded to the throne of Prussia May 31, 1740.
Few of his projects of universal philanthropy and philosophical
regeneration of human nature survived the hardening experiences
of royal ambition, but while his power was yet in its
first bloom he made haste to get rid of this relic of unreasoning
cruelty. It was almost his earliest official act, for the
cabinet order abolishing torture is dated June 3d.<a id="FNanchor_1858_1858" href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a> Yet even
Frederic could not absolutely shake off the traditional belief
in its necessity when the safety of the State or of the head of
the State was concerned. Treason and rebellion and some
other atrocious crimes were excepted from the reform; and
in 1752, at the instance of his high chancellor, Cocceji, by a
special rescript, he ordered two citizens of Oschersleben to be
tortured on suspicion of robbery.<a id="FNanchor_1859_1859" href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> With singular inconsistency,
moreover, torture in a modified form was long permitted
in Prussia, not precisely as a means of investigation, but as a
sort of punishment for obdurate prisoners who would not confess,
and as a means of marking them for subsequent recognition.<a id="FNanchor_1860_1860" href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a>
It is evident that the abrogation of torture did not
carry with it the removal of the evils of the inquisitorial
process.</p>

<p>When the royal philosopher of Europe thus halted in the
reform, it is not singular that his example did not put an end
to the controversy as to the abolition of torture elsewhere.
German jurisprudence, in fact, was not provided with substi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>tutes,
and legists trained in the inquisitorial process might well
hesitate to abandon a system with which they were familiar in
order to enter upon a region of untried experiment for which
there was no provision in the institutions or the ancestral customs
of the land. These natural doubts are well expressed by
Gerstlacher, who, in 1753, published a temperate and argumentative
defence of torture. He enumerates the substitutes
which had been proposed by his opponents, and if he does
them no injustice, the judges of the day might naturally feel
indisposed to experiments so crude and illogical. It seems
that the alternatives offered for the decision of cases in which
the accused could not be convicted by external evidence reduced
themselves to four—to dismiss him without a sentence
either of acquittal or conviction, to make him take an oath of
purgation, to give him an extraordinary (that is to say, a less)
penalty than that provided for the crime, and, lastly, to imprison
him or send him to the galleys or other hard labor,
proportioned to the degree of the evidence against him, until
he should confess.<a id="FNanchor_1861_1861" href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a></p>

<p>In Saxony, as early as 1714, an Electoral Rescript had restricted
jurisdiction over torture to the magistrates of Leipzig,
to whom all proceedings in criminal prosecutions had to be
submitted for examination prior to their confirmation of the
decision of the local tribunals to employ it.<a id="FNanchor_1862_1862" href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> This must have
greatly reduced the amount of wrong and suffering caused by
the system, and thus modified it continued to exist until, in
the remodelling of the Saxon criminal law, between 1770 and
1783, the whole apparatus of torture was swept away. In
Austria the <i>Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana</i>, issued in 1769
by Maria Theresa, still contains elaborate instructions as to
the administration of torture, with careful descriptions and
illustrations of the implements in use and the methods of em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>ploying
them;<a id="FNanchor_1863_1863" href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> but the enlightenment of Joseph II., soon after
his accession in 1780, put an end to the barbarism, and in
Switzerland about the same time it was similarly disused. In
Russia, the Empress Catherine, in 1762, removed it from the
jurisdiction of the inferior courts, where it had been greatly
abused; in 1767, by a secret order, it was restricted to cases
in which the confession of the accused proved actually indispensable,
and even in these it was only permitted under the
special command of governors of provinces.<a id="FNanchor_1864_1864" href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> In the singularly
enlightened instructions which she drew up for the framing
of a new code in 1767, the use of torture was earnestly argued
against in a manner which betrays the influence of Beccaria.<a id="FNanchor_1865_1865" href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a>
Under these auspices it soon became almost obsolete, and it
was finally abolished in 1801. Yet, in some of the States of
central Europe, the progress of enlightenment was wonderfully
slow. Torture continued to disgrace the jurisprudence
of Würtemberg and Bavaria until 1806 and 1807. Though the
wars of Napoleon abolished it temporarily in other States, on
his fall in 1814 it was actually restored. In 1819, however,
George IV. consented, at the request of his subjects, to dispense
with it in Hanover; while in Baden it continued to
exist until 1831. Yet legists who had been trained in the
old school could not admit the soundness of modern ideas,
and in the greater part of Germany the theories which resulted
in the use of torture continued to prevail. The secret
inquisitorial process was retained and the principle that the
confession of the accused was requisite to his condemnation.
Torture of some kind is necessary to render the practical application
of this system efficacious, and accordingly, though
the rack and strappado were abolished, their place was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
by other modes in reality not less cruel. When appearances
were against the prisoner, he was confined for an indefinite
period and subjected to all the hard usage to be expected from
officials provoked by his criminal obstinacy. He was brought
up repeatedly before his judge and exposed to the most searching
interrogatories and terrified with threats. Legists, unwilling
to abandon the powerful weapon which had placed every
accused person at their mercy, imagined a new justification for
its revival. It was held that every criminal owed to society a
full and free confession. His refusal to do this was a crime,
so that if his answers were unsatisfactory to the judge the latter
could punish him on the spot for contumacy. As this punishment
was usually administered with the scourge, it will be
seen that the abolition of torture was illusory, and that
the worst abuses to which it gave rise were carefully retained.<a id="FNanchor_1866_1866" href="#Footnote_1866_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a>
Indeed, if we are to accept literally some letters of
M. A. Eubule-Evans in the London “Times” of 1872, the
<i>Untersuchungschaft</i> or inquisitorial process as employed in
Prussia to the present day lacks little of the worst abuses recorded
by Sprenger and Bodin. The accused while under
detention is subjected to both physical and moral torture, and
is carefully watched by spies. In the prison of Bruchsal there
is a machine to which the prisoner is attached by leather thongs
passed around head, trunk, and limbs, and drawn so tight that
the arrested circulation forces the blood from mouth and ears;
or he is confined, perhaps for a week at a time, in a small cell
of which floor and sides are covered with sharp wooden wedges,
rivalling the fragments of potsherds which Prudentius considered
the crowning effort of devilish ingenuity for the torture
of Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>Spain, as may readily be imagined, was in no haste to
reform the ancient system of procedure. As late as 1796, in
the Vice-royalty of New Granada, when the spread of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
ideas of the French Revolution began to infect society, some
pasquinades appeared in Santafé displeasing to the government.
Though the Viceroy Ezpeleta was regarded as a
singularly enlightened man, he had a number of persons
arrested on suspicion, one of whom was put to the torture to
discover the author of the obnoxious epigrams. It is satisfactory
to know that although several of the accused were
convicted and sent to Spain to serve out long terms of punishment,
on their arrival at Madrid they were all discharged
and compensated.<a id="FNanchor_1867_1867" href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> After the revolution, the authorized use
of torture was abolished, but as recently as 1879 its application,
by various methods showing skill and experience in its
use, on an American citizen falsely accused of theft, led to a
correspondence between the governments of Venezuela and
the United States, recorded in the journals of the time.</p>

<p>In the mother country the employment of torture, though
becoming rarer as the eighteenth century neared its end, continued
legal until the overthrow of the old monarchy, and it
was not abolished until the Cortes of Cadiz in 1811 revolutionized
all the institutions of the nation. In the reaction which
followed the return of the Bourbons it was not reinstated, but
moderated appliances known as <i>apremios</i>—which were sometimes
as severe as the rack or the pulley—continued to be used,
especially in political offences, by the arbitrary despotism of
the Restoration.<a id="FNanchor_1868_1868" href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a></p>

<p>Even France had maintained a conservatism which may
seem surprising in that centre of the philosophic speculation
of the eighteenth century. Her leading writers had not hesitated
to condemn the use of torture. In the <i>Esprit des Lois</i>, in
1748, Montesquieu stamped his reprobation on the system with
a quiet significance which showed that he had on his side all
the great thinkers of the age, and that he felt argument to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
mere surplusage.<a id="FNanchor_1869_1869" href="#Footnote_1869_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> Voltaire did not allow its absurdities and
incongruities to escape. In 1765 he endeavored to arouse
public opinion on the case of the Chevalier de la Barre, a
youthful officer only twenty years of age, who was tortured and
executed on an accusation of having recited a song insulting
to Mary Magdalen and of having mutilated with his sword a
wooden crucifix on the bridge of Abbeville.<a id="FNanchor_1870_1870" href="#Footnote_1870_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a> He was more
successful in attracting the attention of all Europe to the
celebrated <i>affaire Calas</i> which, in 1761, had furnished a
notable example of the useless cruelty of the system. In that
year, at midnight of Oct. 13th, at Toulouse, the body of Marc-Antoine
Calas was found strangled in the back shop of his
father. The family were Protestants and the murdered man
had given signs of conversion to Catholicism, in imitation of
his younger brother. A minute investigation left scarcely a
doubt that the murder had been committed by the father, from
religious motives, and he was condemned to death. He appealed
to the Parlement of Toulouse, which after a patient
hearing sentenced him to the wheel, and to the <i>question ordinaire
et extraordinaire</i>, to extract a confession. He underwent
the extremity of torture and the hideous punishment of
being broken alive without varying from his protestations of
innocence. Though both trials appear to have been conducted
with rigorous impartiality, the Protestantism of Europe saw in
the affair the evidence of religious persecution, and a fearful
outcry was raised. Voltaire, ever on the watch for means to
promote toleration and freedom of thought, seized hold of it
with tireless energy, and created so strong an agitation on the
subject that in 1764 the supreme tribunal at Paris reversed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
sentence, discharged the other members of the family, who
had been subjected to various punishments, and rehabilitated
the memory of Calas.<a id="FNanchor_1871_1871" href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> When Louis XVI., at the opening of
his reign, proposed to introduce many long-needed reforms,
Voltaire took advantage of the occasion to address to him in
1777 an earnest request to include among them the disuse of
torture;<a id="FNanchor_1872_1872" href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> yet it was not until 1780 that the <i>question préparatoire</i>
was abolished by a royal edict which, in a few weighty
lines, indicated that only the reverence for traditional usage
had preserved it so long.<a id="FNanchor_1873_1873" href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> This edict, however, was not
strictly obeyed, and cases of the use of torture still occasionally
occurred, as that of Marie Tison at Rouen, in 1788,
accused of the murder of her husband, when thumb-screws
were applied to both thumbs and at the same time she was
hoisted in the strappado, in which she was allowed to hang
for an hour after the executioner had reported that both
shoulders were out of joint, all of which was insufficient to
extract a confession.<a id="FNanchor_1874_1874" href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> There evidently was occasion for
another ordonnance, which in that same year, 1788, was
promulgated in order to insure the observance of the previous
one.<a id="FNanchor_1875_1875" href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a> In fact, when the States-General was convened
in 1879, the <i>cahier des doléances</i> of Valenciennes contained
a prayer for the abolition of torture, showing that it had not
as yet been discontinued there.<a id="FNanchor_1876_1876" href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a> The <i>question définitive</i> or
<i>préalable</i>, by which the prisoner after condemnation was
again tortured to discover his accomplices, still remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
until 1788, when it, too, was abolished, at least temporarily.
It was pronounced uncertain, cruel to the convict and perplexing
to the judge, and, above all, dangerous to the innocent
whom the prisoner might name in the extremity of his
agony to procure its cessation, and whom he would persist
in accusing to preserve himself from its repetition. Yet,
with strange inconsistency, the abolition of this cruel wrong
was only provisional, and its restoration was threatened in a
few years, if the tribunals should deem it necessary.<a id="FNanchor_1877_1877" href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a> When
those few short years came around they dawned on a new
France, from which the old systems had been swept away as
by the besom of destruction; and torture as an element of
criminal jurisprudence was a thing of the past. By the decree
of October 9th, 1789, it was abolished forever.</p>

<p>In Italy, Beccaria, in 1764, took occasion to devote a few
pages of his treatise on crimes and punishments to the subject
of torture, and its illogical cruelty could not well be exposed
with more terseness and force.<a id="FNanchor_1878_1878" href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> It was probably due to the
movement excited by this work that in 1786 torture was
formally abolished in Tuscany. In this the enlightened Grand-duke
Leopold was in advance of his time, and the despots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
who ruled the divided fractions of the peninsula, although
they might be willing to banish torture from ordinary criminal
jurisprudence, had too well-grounded a distrust of the fidelity
of their subjects to divest themselves of this resource in the
suppression of political offences. Hardly had the Bourbons,
after the overthrow of Napoleon, been reseated on the throne
of the Two Sicilies when the restless dissatisfaction of the
people seemed to justify the severest measures for the maintenance
of so-called order. The troubles of 1820 led to arming
the police with exceptional and summary jurisdiction, under
which it deemed itself authorized to employ any methods
requisite to detect and punish conspirators. This continued
until the revolution of 1848 aggravated the fears of absolutism,
and from its suppression until the expedition of Garibaldi
the régime of the Neapolitan dominions was an organized
Terror. Grave as we have seen were the abuses of torture
when systematized in the detection of crime, they were outstripped
by the licensed cruelty of the ex-galley slaves of the
Neapolitan police, who were restrained by no codes or rules
of practice, and were eager to demonstrate their zeal by the
number of their victims. The terrible secrets of the dungeons
of Naples and Palermo may never see the light, but enough is
known to show that they rivalled those of Ezzelin da Romano.
Police agents competed in inventing new and hideous modes
of inflicting pain. Neither age nor sex was spared. In one
case an old man and his daughter, five months gone in pregnancy,
died under the lash. If a suspected man took alarm
and fled, his mother or his wife and daughters would be tortured
to discover his hiding-place. The evil records of the
dark ages have nothing to show more brutal and inhuman
than the application of torture in Naples and Sicily in the
second half of the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1879_1879" href="#Footnote_1879_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a></p>

<p>That the mortal duel between autocracy and Nihilism in
Russia should lead to the employment of torture in unravelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
the desperate conspiracies of the malcontents is so natural
that we may readily accept the current assertions of the fact.
The conspirators are said frequently to carry poison in order,
if arrested, to save themselves from endless torment and the
risk of being forced to betray associates, and the friends of
prisoners spare no effort to convey to them some deadly drug
by means of which they may escape the infliction. Polish
aspirations for liberty are repressed in the same manner, and
in 1890 the journal’s recorded the case of Ladislas Guisbert,
rendered insane by the prolonged administration of Marsigli’s
favorite torment of sleeplessness.</p>

<p>So long as human nature retains its imperfections the baffled
impatience of the strong will be apt to wreak its vengeance on
the weak and defenceless. As recently as 1867, in Texas, the
Jefferson “Times” records a case in which, under the auspices
of the military authorities, torture was applied to two negroes
suspected of purloining a considerable amount of money
which had been lost by a revenue collector. More recently
still, in September, 1868, the London journals report fearful
barbarities perpetrated by the Postmaster-General of Roumania
to trace the authors of a mail robbery. A woman was hung
to a beam with hot eggs under the armpits; others were burned
with grease and petroleum, while others again were tied by
the hair to horses’ tails and dragged through thorn bushes.
It must be added that the offending officials were promptly
dismissed and committed for trial. A still more recent case
is one which has been the subject of legislative discussion
in Switzerland, where it appears that in the Canton of Zug,
under order of court, a man suspected of theft was put on
bread and water from Oct. 26th to Nov. 10th, 1869, to extort
confession, and when this failed he was subjected to
thumb-screws and beaten with rods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In casting a retrospective glance over this long history of
cruelty and injustice, it is saddening to observe that Christian
communities, where the truths of the Gospel were received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
with unquestioning veneration, systematized the administration
of torture with a cold-blooded ferocity unknown to the legislation
of the heathen nations whence they derived it. The careful restrictions
and safeguards, with which the Roman jurisprudence
sought to protect the interests of the accused, contrast strangely
with the reckless disregard of every principle of justice which
sullies the criminal procedure of Europe from the thirteenth
to the nineteenth century. From this no race or religion has
been exempt. What the Calvinist suffered in Flanders, he
inflicted in Holland; what the Catholic enforced in Italy, he
endured in England; nor did either of them deem that he
was forfeiting his share in the Divine Evangel of peace on
earth and goodwill to men.</p>

<p>The mysteries of the human conscience and of human
motives are well-nigh inscrutable, and it may seem shocking
to assert that these centuries of unmitigated wrong are indirectly
traceable to that religion of which the second great
commandment was that man should love his neighbor as himself.
Yet so it was. The first commandment, to love God
with all our heart, when perverted by superstition, gave a
strange direction to the teachings of Christ. For ages, the
assumptions of an infallible Church had led men to believe
that the interpreter was superior to Scripture. Every expounder
of the holy text felt in his inmost heart that he
alone, with his fellows, worshipped God as God desired to be
worshipped, and that every ritual but his own was an insult to
the Divine nature. Outside of his own communion there was
no escape from eternal perdition, and the fervor of religious
conviction thus made persecution a duty to God and man.
This led the Inquisition, as we have seen, to perfect a system
of which the iniquity was complete. Thus commended, that
system became part and parcel of secular law, and when the
Reformation arose the habits of thought which ages had consolidated
were universal. The boldest Reformers who shook
off the yoke of Rome, as soon as they had attained power,

their interpretation of divine truth, and in applying to secular
as well as to religious affairs the cruel maxims in which they
had been educated.</p>

<p>Yet, in the general enlightenment which caused and accompanied
the Reformation, there passed away gradually the
passions which had created the rigid institutions of the Middle
Ages. Those institutions had fulfilled their mission, and the
savage tribes that had broken down the worn-out civilization
of Rome were at last becoming fitted for a higher civilization
than the world had yet seen, wherein the precepts of the
Gospel might at length find practical expression and realization.
For the first time in the history of man the universal
love and charity which lie at the foundation of Christianity
are recognized as the elements on which human society should
be based. Weak and erring as we are, and still far distant
from the ideal of the Saviour, yet are we approaching it, even
if our steps are painful and hesitating. In the slow evolution
of the centuries, it is only by comparing distant periods that
we can mark our progress; but progress nevertheless exists,
and future generations, perhaps, may be able to emancipate
themselves wholly from the cruel and arbitrary domination of
superstition and force.</p>

Even among the remnants of the pre-Aryan races of India the same
customs are traceable. Early in the present century Lieutenant Shaw described
the hill-tribes of Rajmahal, to the north of Bengal, as recognizing
the responsibility of the injurer to the injured; compensation was assessed
at the pleasure of the complainant, and the kindred of the offender were
compelled to contribute to it, exactly as among the barbarians who occupied
Europe (Asiatic Researches, Vol. IV.).</p></div>

The oath may be regarded as the foundation of Roman legal procedure—“Dato

D. <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> ii. The <i>jusjurandum necessarium</i> could always be administered
by the judge in cases of deficient evidence, and the <i>jusjurandum in jure</i>
proffered by the plaintiff to the defendant was conclusive: “Manifestæ
turpitudinis et confessionis est nolle nec jurare nec jusjurandum referre”—Ibid.

Thus Alfonso the Wise endeavored to introduce into Spain the mutual
challenging of the parties involved in the Roman <i>jusjurandum in jure</i>, by
his <i>jura de juicio</i> (Las Siete Partidas, P. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Tit. xi. l. 2. Cf. Espéculo,
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> Tit. xi. ley 2). Oddly enough, the same procedure is found incorporated
in the municipal law of Rheims in the fourteenth century, probably
introduced by some over-zealous civilian; “Si alicui deferatur jusjurandum,
necesse habet jurare vel referre jusjurandum, et hoc super quovis debito, vel
inter quasvis personas”—Lib. Pract. de Consuetud. Remens. § 15 (Archives
Législat. de Reims, P. I. p. 37). By this time, however, the oaths
of parties had assumed great importance. In the legislation of St. Louis,
they occupy a position which was a direct incentive to perjury. Thus he
provides for the hanging of the owner of a beast which had killed a man,
if he was foolish enough not to swear that he was ignorant of its being
vicious. “Et si il estoit si fox que il deist que il seust la teche de la beste,
il en seroit pendus pour la recoignoissance”—Établissements, Liv. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> chap.
cxxi.
</p>
<p>
A charter granted to the commune of Lorris, in 1155, by Louis le Jeune,
gives to burghers the privilege of rebutting by oath, without conjurators, an
accusation unsupported by testimony—Chart. Ludovic. junior. ann. 1155,
cap. xxxii. (Isambert, Anciennes Lois Françaises I. 157.) And, in comparatively
modern times, in Germany, the same rule was followed. “Juramento
rei, quod purgationis vocatur, sæpe etiam innocentia, utpote quæ in
anima constitit, probatur et indicia diluuntur;” and this oath was administered
when the evidence was insufficient to justify torture. (Zangeri Tract.
de Quæstionibus, cap. iii. No. 46.) In 1592, Zanger wrote an elaborate essay
to prove the evils of the custom.
</p>
<p>
It is a noteworthy fact, however, that of all the medieval codes the one
least affected by the influence of the Roman law was the Saxon, and in
this the purgatorial power of the oath was admitted to a degree unknown
elsewhere. The accused was allowed in certain cases to clear himself,
however notorious were the facts, and no evidence was admitted to disprove
his position, unless it were a question of theft, and the stolen articles
were found in his possession, or he had suffered a previous conviction.
(Jur. Provin. Saxon. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> Art. 15, 18, 39; Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Art. 4, 72.) Even
this was an improvement on the previous custom, if we may believe Cardinal
Henry of Susa, who denounces the practice in Saxony and Dacia,
where a man can clear himself, even if he holds the stolen article in his
hand and the loser has ample witnesses present (Hostiensis Aureæ Summæ
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> De Purg. canon. § 3). This irrational abuse was long in vogue,
and was denounced by the council of Bâle in the fifteenth century (Schilter.
Thesaur. II. 291). It only prevailed in the north of Germany; the Jus
Provin. Alaman. (cap. ccclxxxi. § 3), which regulated Southern Germany,
alludes to it as one of the distinguishing features of the Saxon code.
</p>
<p>
So, also, at the same period a special privilege was claimed by the inhabitants
of Franconia, in virtue of which a murderer was allowed to rebut with
his single oath all testimony as to his guilt, unless he chanced to be caught
with the red hand—Jur. Provin. Alaman. cap. cvi. § 7.</p></div>

Bonifacii Epist. cxxvi.
</p>
<p>
The subject of the oaths of priests was one of considerable perplexity
during the dark ages. Among the numerous privileges assumed by the
sacerdotal body was exemption from the necessity of swearing, an exemption
which had the justification of the ancient Roman custom; “Sacerdotem,
Vestalem, et Flaminem Dialem in omni mea jurisdictione jurare non
cogam” (Edict. Perpet. ap. Aul. Gell. x. 15). The effort to obtain the
reversion of this privilege dates from an early period, and was sometimes
allowed and sometimes rejected by the secular authorities, both as respects
promissory, judicial, and exculpatory oaths. The struggle between church
and state on this subject is well exemplified in a case which occurred in
1269. The Archbishop of Reims sued a burgher of Chaudardre.
When each party had to take the oath, the prelate demanded that his should
be taken by his attorney. The defendant demurred to this, alleging that
the archbishop had in person presented the complaint. Appeal was made
to the Parlement of Paris, which decided that the defendant’s logic was
correct, and that the personal oath of the prelate was requisite (Olim, I.
765).
</p>
<p>
In Spain, a bishop appearing in a secular court, either as plaintiff or
defendant, was not exempt from the oath, but had the singular privilege of
not being compelled to touch the gospels on which he swore.—Siete
Partidas, P. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Tit. xl. l. 24.</p></div>

<p>
This point illustrates the essential distinction between witnesses and
compurgators. The Roman law exercised great discrimination in admitting
the evidence of a relative to either party in an action (Pauli Sentent.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> Tit. xv.—Ll. 4, 5, 6, 9. Dig. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXII.</span> v.). The Wisigoths not
only adopted this principle, but carried it so far as to exclude the evidence
of a kinsman in a cause between his relative and a stranger (L.
Wisigoth. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Tit. iv. c. 12), which was adopted into the Carlovingian
legislation (Benedict. Levit. Capitul. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> c. 348) under the strong
Romanizing influence which then prevailed. The rule, once established,
retained its place through the vicissitudes of the feudal and customary law
(Beaumanoir, Coutumes du Beauvoisis, cap. xxxix. § 38.—Cout. de Bretagne,
Tit. vii. art. 161, 162). In the ancient Brahmanic legislation the
evidence of both friends and enemies was excluded (Institutes of Vishnu,
viii. 3).</p></div>

This has been denied by those who assume that the <i>frithborgs</i> of Edward
the Confessor are the earliest instance of such institutions, but traces
of communal societies are to be found in the most ancient text of the Salic
law (First text of Pardessus, Tit. <span class="smcap lowercase">XLV.</span>), and both Childebert and Clotair II.,
in edicts promulgated near the close of the sixth century, hold the hundreds
or townships responsible for robberies committed within their limits (Decret.
Childeberti ann. 595, c. 10; Decret. Chlotarii II. c. 1).
</p>
<p>
It is not improbable that, as among all the barbarian races, the family
was liable for the misdeeds of its members, so the tribe or clan of the
offender was held responsible when the offence was committed upon a
member of another tribe, and such edicts as those of Childebert and Clotair
were merely adaptations of the rule to the existing condition of society.
The most perfect early code that has reached us, that of the ancient Irish,
expresses in detail the responsibility of each sept for the actions not only
of its members, but of those also who were in any way connected with it.
“And because the four nearest tribes bear the crime of each kinsman of
their stock.... And because there are four who have an interest in every
one who sues and is sued: the tribe of the father, the chief, the church,
the tribe of the mother or foster-father.... Every tribe is liable after the
absconding of a member of it, after notice, after warning, and after lawful
waiting.”—Senchus Mor, I. 263-5.</p></div>

husband accusing his wife of infidelity, and having no witnesses to prove
it, shall substantiate his assertion by swearing five times to the truth of the
charge, invoking upon himself the malediction of God; while the wife was
able to rebut the accusation by the same process. As this chapter, however,
was revealed to the Prophet after he had writhed for a month under
a charge brought against his favorite wife Ayesha, which he could not disregard
and did not wish to entertain, the law is rather to be looked upon as
<i>ex post facto</i> than as indicating any peculiar tendency of the age or race.</p></div>

being 200 solidi; the <i>radcnicht</i> (road-knight, or mounted follower) was a

a similar scale of valuation, which was in force even subsequently to the
Conquest (Leg. Henrici I. Tit. lxiv. § 2).</p></div>

For instance, in the Baioarian law—“Nec facile ad sacramenta veniatur....
In his vero causis sacramenta præstentur in quibus nullam probationem
discussio judicantis invenerit” (L. Baioar. Tit. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> c. 16). In
a Capitulary of Louis le Débonnaire—“Si hujus facti testes non habuerit
cum duodecim conjuratoribus legitimis per sacramentum adfirmet” (Capit.
Ludov. Pii ann. 819, § 1). In one of the Emperor Lothair—“Si testes
habere non poterit, concedimus ut cum XII. juratoribus juret” (L. Longobard.
Lib. I. Tit. IX. § 37). So Louis II., in 854, ordered that a man
accused of harboring robbers, if taken in the act, was to be immediately
punished; but if merely cited on popular rumor, he was at liberty to clear
himself with twelve compurgators (Recess. Ticinen. Tit. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. 3).
</p>
<p>
It was the same in subsequent periods. The Scottish law of the thirteenth
century alludes to the absence of testimony as a necessary preliminary, but
when an acquittal was once obtained in this manner the accused seems to
have been free from all subsequent proceedings, when inconvenient witnesses
might perhaps turn up—“Et si hoc modo purgatus fuerit, absolvetur
a petitione Regis in posterum” (Regiam Majestatem, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> c. 21).
So, in the laws of Nieuport, granted by Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders,
in 1163 “Et si hoc scabini vel opidani non cognoverint, conquerens
cum juramento querelam suam sequetur, et alter se excusabit juramento
quinque hominum” (Leg. secundæ Noviportus). See also the Consuetud.
Tornacens. ann. 1187, §§ ii. iii. xvi., where two conjurators release a
defendant from a claim of debt unsupported by evidence. In case of assault,
“si constans non fuerit,” two conjurators clear the accused; in case of
wounding, six are required if the affair occurred by daylight; if at night,
the cold water ordeal is prescribed (D’Achery, Spicileg. III. 551-2). The
legislation of Norway and Iceland in the next century is even more positive
“Iis tantum concessis quæ legum codices sanciunt, juramenta nempe
purgatoria et accusatoria, ubi legitimi defuerint testes” (Jarnsida, Mannhelge,
cap. xxxvii.).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, an exception to this general principle is apparently
found in a constitution of the Emperor Henry III., issued about the middle
of the eleventh century “Si quem ex his dominus suus accusaverit de
quacunque re, licet illi juramento se cum suis coæqualibus absolvere,
exceptis tribus: hoc est si in vitam domini sui, aut in cameram ejus consilium
habuisse arguitur, aut in munitiones ejus. Cæteris vero hominibus
de quacunque objectione, absque advocato, cum suis coæqualibus juramento
se poterit absolvere” (Goldast. Constit. Imp. I. 231).
</p>
<p>
In a constitution of Frederic II. in 1235, the oaths of six compurgators
clear a man accused of having commenced hostilities without awaiting the
three days term prescribed after defiance, no evidence being alluded to on
either side—“et nisi violator productus super hoc vel septena manu sinodalium
hominum purgaverit innocentiam suam quod non commiserat contra
hoc statutum perpetuo pene subiaceat quod dicitur erenlos und rehtlos”—Nove
Constitutiones Dom. Alberti, p. 12 (Weimar, 1858).</p></div>

“In aliis enim curiis si quis aliquid dixerit unde eum pœnituerit, poterit
id negare contra totam curiam tertia manu cum sacramento, id se non

jurisprudence, this unsophisticated mode of beclouding justice was obtained
by insisting on the employment of lawyers, whose assertions would not be
binding on their clients. Thus, in the Assises de Jerusalem (Baisse Court,

parole quil ne doie dire por celuy cui il parole, celui por qui il parle et son
conceau y pueent bien amender ains que le iugement soit dit. Mais se
celuy de cui est li plais diseit parole qui li deust torner a damage, il ne la

in the German procedure of the fourteenth century—“verbis procuratoris

The rapidity with which the study of the civil law diffused itself
throughout the schools and the eagerness with which it was welcomed
were the subject of indignant comment by the ecclesiastics of the day. As
early as 1149 we find St. Bernard regretting that the laws of Justinian were
already overshadowing those of God—“Et quidem quotidie perstrepent in
palatio leges, sed Justiniani, non Domini” (De Consideratione, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap.
iv.). Even more bitter were the complaints of Giraldus Cambrensis towards
the end of the century. The highest of high churchmen, in deploring
the decline of learning among the prelates and clergy of his age, he
attributes it to the exclusive attention bestowed on the jurisprudence of Justinian,
which already offered the surest prizes to cupidity and ambition, and
he quotes in support of his opinion the dictum of his teacher Mainier, a
professor in the University of Paris: “Episcopus autem ille, de quo nunc
ultimo locuti sumus, inter superficiales numerari potuit, cujusmodi hodie
multos novimus propter leges Justinianas, quæ literaturam, urgente cupiditatis
et ambitionis incommodo, adeo in multis jam suffocarunt, quod magistrum
Mainerium in auditorio scholæ suæ Parisius dicentem et damna sui
temporis plangentem, audivi, vaticinium illud Sibillæ vere nostris diebus
esse completum, hoc scilicet ‘Venient dies, et væ illis, quibus leges obliterabunt
scientiam literarum’” (Gemm. Ecclesiast. Dist. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. xxxvii.).
This, like all other branches of learning, was as yet to a great extent in
the hands of the clergy, though already were arising the precursors of those
subtle and daring civil lawyers who were destined to do such yeoman’s
service in abating the pretensions of the church.
</p>
<p>
It is somewhat singular to observe that at a period when the highest
offices of the law were frequently appropriated by ecclesiastics, they were
not allowed to perform the functions of advocates or counsel. See Horne’s
Myrror of Justice, cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> sect. 5. There was good reason for prohibiting
them from serving as judges, as Frederic II. did in 1235—“Idem erit
laicus propter sententias sanguinum quas clerico scribere non liceat, et
præterea ut si dilinquid in officio suo pena debita puniatur” (Nove Constitutiones
Dom. Alberti, p. 46).</p></div>

cujus naturali ratione probatio nulla est ... magna sit differentia
(Const. x. C. de non numerat. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> 30). It is a little curious to
see how completely this was opposed to the principle of the early Common
Law of England, by which in actions for debt “semper incumbit probatio
neganti” (Fleta, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. lxiii. § 11).</p></div>

Though absent from the general laws of Spain, yet compurgation had
been introduced as an occasional custom. We have seen it above (p. 49)
in the Fuero de Balbás in 1135. The Fuero of Madrid in 1202 provides
that a man suspected of homicide and other crimes, in the absence of testimony,
can clear himself with six or twelve conjurators, according to the
grade of the offence (Mem. de la Real. Acad. de la Historia, 1852). We
shall see hereafter that it appears in the Fuero Viejo of Castile in 1356.
The passage from the Romancero del Cid, quoted above, shows the hold it
had on the popular imagination.</p></div>

The word “secta” is a troublesome one to legal antiquarians from its
diverse significations. As used in the above text it means the supporters
of the plaintiff’s case. Elsewhere we find it denoting the hue and cry,
which all men were bound to follow; see Stubb’s Select Charters, pp. 256,
366, etc. “Facere sectam” also seems to have the sense of holding court
(Ib. p. 303), whence it also derives a secondary meaning of jurisdiction
(Baildon, Select Civil Pleas, I. 42).</p></div>

Nov. Assizes, 1638.—“Arthur Thorne being presented by the minister
and church wardens of Pembroke tribe [parish] upon suspition of incontinency
with Elizabeth Jenour the wyfe of Mr. Anthony Jenour, was
censured [sentenced] in case he could not purge himself to doe open penaunce
in two churches.” He probably failed in his purgation, for Mrs. Jenour
confessed her sin in open court and was referred to her minister for penance.
</p>
<p>
June Assizes, 1639. “The minister, church wardens, and sydesmen of
Sandy’s Tribe doe present Mary Eldrington, the wyfe of Roger Eldrington,
upon suspition of incontinency grounded on comon fame: upon which
presentment she was censured to doe open penaunce in the church in case she
could not purge herselfe by the oath of 3 women of credit in the Tribe.”
</p>
<p>
“Edward Bowly, presented upon suspition of incontinency with Anne, a
negro woman, supposed to be the father of her bastard child, was put to
his compurgators, and did thereupon purge himself, and the negro woman
censured to receave 21 lashes at the whipping-post, which was executed
upon her.”
</p>
<p>
“Edward Wolsey and Dorathie Penniston were presented upon common
fame for suspition of incontinencie by the grand inquest, and also presented
by the minister and churchwardens of Pembroke Tribe upon the like suspition,
whereupon they were sentenced to doe penaunce in the church, standing
in a whyte sheete during divine service, making confession of that their
suspitious walking in case they could not purge themselves by their owne
oathes and two sufficient compurgators.”</p></div>

Thus, as late as the thirteenth century, the municipal law of Southern
Germany, in prescribing the duel for cases destitute of testimony, says with
a naïve impiety: “Hoc ideo statutum est, quod causa hæc nemini cognita
est quam Deo, cujus est eandem juste decidere.” Early in the sixteenth
century the pious Aventinus regretfully looks back upon the time when
princes and priests, assembled to witness the combat, “divinam opem
implorabant, beneficia memoriter commemorabant quæ in simili negotio
Deus immortalis Christus servator noster ipsis pro sua benignitate atque
clementia contulisset ... comprecabantur ut summa potestas in re
præsenti, pollicita re, hactenus semper factitasset, comprobaret” (Aventini
Annal. Baior. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> cap. xiv. n. 28). Even as late as 1617, August
Viescher, in an elaborate treatise on the judicial duel, expressed the same
reliance on the divine interposition: “Dei enim hoc judicium dicitur, soli
Deo causa terminanda committitur, Deo igitur authore singulare hoc certamen
suscipiendum, ut justo judicio adjutor sit, omnisque spes ad solam
summæ providentiam Trinitatis referenda est” (Viescher Tract. Juris
Duellici Universi, p. 109). This work is a most curious anachronism.
Viescher was a learned jurisconsult who endeavored to revive the judicial
duel in the seventeenth century by writing a treatise of 700 pages on its
principles and practice. He exhibits the wide range of his studies by citations
from no less than six hundred and seventy-one authors, and manages
to convey an incredibly small amount of information on the subject.
Ephraim Gerhardt, moreover, taxes him with wholesale plagiarism from
Michael Beuther’s <i>Disputatio de duello</i> (Strassburg, 1609) and with false
citations of authorities.—Eph. Gerhardi Tract. de Judicio Duellico, præfat.</p></div>

The early edicts directed against the duel proper (Ordonn. Charles IX.,
an. 1566; Henri IV., an. 1602—in Fontanon I. 665) refer exclusively to
the noblesse, and to those entitled to bear arms, as addicted to the practice,
while the judicial combat, as we shall see, was open to all ranks, and
was enforced indiscriminately upon all.</p></div>

An outlying fragment of the same belief is to be seen in the ancient
Japanese practice of deciding knotty questions by the judicial duel (Griffis’s
Mikado’s Empire, New York, 1876, p. 92). Even the most savage of existing
races, the aborigines of Australia, have a kind of duel under certain
rules by which private controversies are settled, and among the Melanesians
the custom prevails, champions even being sometimes employed (Patetta,

In Horne’s Myrror of Justice (cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> sect. 13), a work which is supposed
to date from the reign of Edward II., there is a form of appeal of
treachery “qui fuit trové en vielx rosles del temps du Roy Alfred,” in
which the appellant offers to prove the truth of his charge with his body;
but no confidence can be placed in the accuracy of the old lawyer. Some
antiquarians have been inclined to assume that the duel was practised
among the Anglo-Saxons, but the statement in the text is confirmed by the
authority of Mr. Pike (Hist. of Crime in England, I. 448), whose exhaustive
researches into the original sources of English jurisprudence render
his decision virtually final.
</p>
<p>
In the Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson it is related that he was chosen by an
English queen named Gyda for her husband, to the great displeasure of
Alfin a previous pretender to her hand, who challenged him thereupon,
because “It was then the custom in England, if two strove for anything,
to settle the matter by single combat” (Laing’s Heimskringla, I. 400).
Snorro Sturleson, however, can hardly be regarded as of much authority
on a point like this; and as Gyda is represented as daughter of a king of
Dublin, the incident, if it occurred at all, may have taken place in Ireland.</p></div>

A charter issued by William, which appears to date early in his reign,
gives the widest latitude to the duel both for his French and Saxon subjects
(L. Guillelmi Conquest. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> §§ 1, 2, 3. Thorpe, I. 488). Another law,
however, enabled a Norman defendant to decline the combat when a Saxon
was appellant. “Si Francigena appellaverit Anglum ... Anglus se
defendat per quod melius voluerit, aut judicio ferri, aut duello.... Si
autem Anglus Francigenam appellaverit et probare voluerit, judicio aut
duello, volo tunc Francigenam purgare se sacramento non fracto” (Ibid.
<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> § 12. Thorpe, I. 493). Such immunity seems a singular privilege for
the generous Norman blood.</p></div>

Even as late as the middle of the thirteenth century St. Ramon de

probationem veritatis, ita videlicet ut qui vicerit probasse intelligitur; et

proved insufficient, for a subsequent enactment provides an enormous fine
(300 solidi) to be levied on the witnesses of a losing party, by way of making
them share in the punishment, “Quo facilius in posterum ne quis audeat
propria pravitate mentire.”—L. Burgund. Tit. lxxx. § 2. The position of
a witness in those unceremonious days was indeed an unenviable one.</p></div>

Thus in a case in 1220 involving a stolen mare, the accused gave a
warrantor, and on the accuser challenging him to battle he gave a second
warrantor. On investigation he was found to have received five marks for
the service with a promise of five more, and he was mercifully treated by
being condemned only to the loss of a foot—“Sciendum quod misericorditer

Beaumanoir, ch. xxxix. §§ 30, 31, 66.—Assises de Jerusalem, cap. 169.
A somewhat similar principle is in force in the modern jurisprudence of China.
Women, persons over eighty or under ten years of age, and cripples who
have lost an eye or a limb are entitled to buy themselves off from punishment,
except in a few cases of aggravated crime. They are, therefore, not
allowed to appear as accusers, because they are enabled by this privilege to
escape the penalties of false witness.—Staunton, Penal Code of China, Sects.
20-22, and 339. In the ancient Brahmanic law also there is a long enumeration
of persons who are not receivable as witnesses, including women,
children, and men over eighty years of age. In this, however, the exclusion
of women would appear to be because they were presumably under
tutelage.—Institutes of Vishnu, <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> 2.
</p>
<p>
The exclusion of women as witnesses during the mediæval period was also
one of the numerous disabilities by which the Church expressed its contempt
for the sex which had tempted Adam to his fall. As early as the fourth
century Hilary the Deacon, in a tract which long passed current under the
name of St. Augustin, says: “Nec docere enim potest, nec testis esse, neque
fidem dicere, neque judicare” (Hilari Diac. Quæstt. ex Vet. Testamento,
c. xlv.—Migne, T. XXX. p. 2244). And this was carried through Ivo of
Chartres (Decreti, P. <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> c. 85) into the body of the canon law (Gratiani
Decr. Caus. <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXIII.</span> Q. v. cap. 17).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

The earliest of these charters is a grant from Louis le Gros in 1109 to
the serfs of the church of Paris, confirmed by Pope Pascal II. in 1113
(Baluz. et Mansi III. 12, 62). D’Achery (Spicileg. III. 481) gives
another from the same monarch in 1128 to the church of Chartres.</p></div>

cap. ix.). The result of a reversal of judgment must probably have been
a heavy fine and deprivation of the judicial function, such being the
penalty provided for injustice in the laws of Henry I.—“Qui injuste judicabit,
cxx sol. reus sit et dignitatem judicandi perdat” (L. Henrici I.
Tit. xiii. § 4)—which accords nearly with the French practice in the time
of Beaumanoir.</p></div>

gist ne vie ne menbre de cels qui sont fausé, en quelconques point que li
fausemenz soit faiz, et quele que la querele soit” (Ibid. Tit. xix.). If the
judge was accused of bribery, however, and was defeated, he was liable to
confiscation and banishment (Tit. xxvi.). The increasing severity meted
out to careless, ignorant, or corrupt judges manifests the powerful influence
of the Roman law, which, aided by the active efforts of legists, was
infiltrating the customary jurisprudence and altering its character everywhere.
Thus de Fontaines quotes with approbation the Code, <i>De pœna
judicis</i> (Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">VII.</span> Tit. xlix. l. 1) as a thing more to be desired than expected,
while in Beaumanoir we already find its provisions rather exceeded than
otherwise.</p></div>

Si contingat ut de justitia sententiæ pugnandum sit, illa pugna debet

In a French version of this code, made probably towards the close of the
fourteenth century, the purport of this passage is entirely changed. “De
chascun iugemant ne puet lan trover leaul ne certain consoil si bien come
per le consoil de sages de la cort le roi.”—Miroir de Souabe, P. I. c. cxiii.
(Ed. Matile, Neufchatel, 1843). We may hence conclude that by this
period the custom of armed appeal was disused, and the extension of the
royal jurisdiction was established.</p></div>

Roderici Toletani de Reb. Hispan. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> xxvi. This story has been
called in question by orthodox writers for the reason that Archbishop
Roderic, who flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century, is the only
authority for it, but there is nothing in the manners of the age to render it
incredible, and he mentions that the champion of the Mozarabic rite came
from Matanza near the Pisuerga, and that his family still existed.
</p>
<p>
In 1121, when the Queen-regent Urraca was at Compostella, one of her
courtiers informed a gentleman of the Archbishop Diego Gelmirez, that she
was plotting to seize him, whereupon he surrounded himself with a guard.
This attracted attention and led to discussion in which the archbishop’s
retainer gave the name of his informant. The latter denied the statement
and Urraca, as a matter of course, ordered the duel between them, in which
her courtier was defeated and was punished with blinding.—Historia Compostellana,

</p>
<p>
In a formula of application for the duel, given by Hermann de Bare (De
Formandis Libellis, 1535), there is no allusion to defect of evidence; it is a
simple assertion of the guilt of the other side with a demand for the duel
in case it is desired.—“Domine Judex, etc. Ego Petrus, etc. Quod Martinus
hic præsens est falsus et proditor, qui perditionaliter rapuit mihi quendam
equum pili mauri, stellatum in fronte, quod si ipse confiteatur peto
ipsum condemnari super prædicta rapina ut raptorem. Si autem hoc neget
ego per pugnam armis paribus sumtis a me et ab eo faciam eum confiteri
palam per os suum in campo nobis per vos assignando, vel reddam eum
victum vel mortuum in dicto campo. Et super dicta pugna pignus meum
vel chyrothecas meas hic in medio in præsentia vestra offero et reddo, et
promitto me juraturum in introitu campi per vos nobis ad certamen seu ad
dictam pugnam assignandi quod ego non habeo herbas nec breves conjuratorias
vel alia quæ maleficia vel fascinationes pariant vel parturiant quoquo
modo. Et quod tunc Martinus juret similiter illud. Item et peto per vos
Dominum judicem si Martinus prædictam rapinam neget declarari et judicari
pugnam posse et debere esse et fieri ex prædicta causa inter me et eum
et ipsum sententialiter condemnari ad subeundam pugnam mecum ex prædicta
causa ut super prædicta rapina possit per pugnam veritas inveniri.”—Eph.

The custom with regard to this varied greatly according to local usage.
Thus, a charter of the Count of Forez in 1270 concedes the right of avoiding
battle, even at the last moment, by satisfying the adversary, and paying
a fine of sixty sols.—Chart. Raynaldi Com. Forens. c. 4 (Bernard, Hist.
du Forez, T. I. Preuves, p. 35). According to the customs of Lorris, in
1155, if a composition was effected after battle had been gaged and before
security was given, each party paid a fine of two sous and a half. If after
security was pledged, the fine was increased to seven sous and a half.—Chart.
Ludov. Junior. ann. 1155, cap. xiv. (Isambert, Anciennes Lois

A MS. at Wolfenbüttel has a miniature virtually the same. In another representation
of these combats, the antagonists are furnished with curved knives
(Würdinger, Beiträge, p. 18).

In many places, however, crimes which a man was forced to disprove by
combat were subject to the ordeal of hot iron or water when the accused
was a woman. Thus, by the Spanish law of the thirteenth century,

It is not easy to understand the remark of Olivier de la Marche, in the
latter half of the fifteenth century (Traités du Duel Judiciaire, p. 44, communicated
to me by George Neilson, Esq.), warning judges that they cannot
condemn clerks to the duel except in cases of <i>lèse majesté</i> and those
affecting the faith. At that time the faith was exclusively in the hands of
the Inquisition, and the canons admit of no exception to clerical immunity
in cases of treason. In both matters torture had long before proved itself
vastly more efficient than the clumsy and doubtful ordeals.</p></div>

parties could be separated on payment of a fine to the court, from the recipient
of which the name is evidently derived. Apparently the good canons
drew a distinction between awarding the duel and engaging in it, for we
have already seen (p. 159) that twenty-four years before they had obtained
from Innocent IV. a special privilege exempting them from the necessity of
maintaining their rights by battle.</p></div>

According to Bracton, the appellant in criminal cases appears always
obliged to swear to his own personal knowledge, <i>visu ac auditu</i>, of the
crime alleged. This, however, was not the case elsewhere. Among the
glossators on the Lombard law there were warm disputes as to the propriety,
in certain cases, of forcing one of the contestants to commit perjury.
The matter will be found treated at some length in Savigny’s
Geschichte d. Rom. Recht. B. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> pp. 159 sqq. Cf. Odofredi Summa de
Pugna (Patetta, pp. 485-7).
</p>
<p>
The formula of the oath as given in the Fleta is as follows: The parties
take each other by the hand and first the appellee swears, “Hoc audis,
homo quem per manum teneo, qui A. te facis appellari per nomen baptismi
tui, quod ego C. fratrem tuum, vel alium parentem vel dominum non occidi,
vel plagam ei feci ullo genere armorum per quod remotior esse debuit a vita
et morti propinquior; sic me Deus adjuvet et hæc Sancta, etc.” Then the
appellant responds: “Hoc audis homo quem per manum teneo, qui te R.
facis appellari per nomen baptismi tui, quod tu es perjurus et ideo perjurus
quia tali anno, tali die, tali hora et tali loco nequiter et in felonia occidisti
C. fratrum meum tali genere armorum, unde obiit infra triduum; sic me
Deus, etc.”—Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap. xxxii. §§ 28, 29.—Bracton, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Tract ii. c.
21, § 2.
</p>

See a case in which Ralph Rusdike, a witness, offers battle against
Elias of Dumbleton—“et Elias defendit totum versus eum ut versus campionem
conductitium et villanus.” Then Ralph shows that he has an interest
in the matter which warrants his acting as appellor and battle is gaged.—Maitland’s
Select Pleas of the Crown, Vol. I. p. 80. Also another case
in 1220 in which the appellant offers a silver mark to the king for opportunity
to prove that an adverse witness is a hired champion.—Ib. p. 124.
Another case in 1220 (p. 137) shows how customary it was to impugn an
adverse witness as a hired champion.</p></div>

This charter, which has recently been found among the records of
Durham Cathedral, is printed in the London <i>Athenæum</i> of November 10th,
1866. It is not dated, but the names of the subscribing witnesses show
that it must have been executed about the year 1260.

I owe to James Clephan, Esq., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, the interesting fact
that the Sherburn Hospital, Durham, is still in possession of the vill of
century by Ralph, son of Paulinus of York, who had obtained it as the
result of a judicial combat between his champion and that of the opposing
claimants.</p></div>

Lord Eldon, in his speech advocating the abolition of trial by battle,
in 1819, stated, “In these the parties were not suffered to fight <i>in propria

the principle that if one of the parties were slain, the suit would abate.”—Campbell’s

The kind of Christianity introduced may be estimated by the character
of the Apostle of Iceland. Deacon Thangbrand was the son of Willibald
Count of Saxony, and even after he had taken orders continued to ply his
old vocation of viking or sea robbing. To get rid of him and to punish
him, King Olaf Tryggvesson of Norway imposed upon him the task of converting
Iceland, which he accomplished with the sword in one hand and
the Bible in the other.—See Dasent, Burnt Njal, II. 361.—Olaf Tryggvesson’s

“Liber adversus Legem Gundobadi” and “Liber contra Judicium
Dei” (Agobardi Opp. Ed. Baluz I. 107, 301). Both of these works display
marked ability, and a spirit of enlightened piety, mingled with frequent
absurdities which show that Agobard could not in all things rise
superior to his age. One of his favorite arguments is that the battle ordeal
was approved by the Arian heretic Gundobald, whom he stigmatizes as
“quidam superbus ac stultus hæreticus Gundobadus Burgundionum rex.”</p></div>

Chronicle (Martene Ampl. Collect. V. 182) locates it at Cambron in
Hainault, and states that the Jew was a favorite of William Count of Hainault.

It is a curious illustration of the fluctuating policy of the contest that in
his struggle to enforce the supremacy of the royal jurisdiction as against the
prelates of the province of Reims, one of the complaints of the bishops at
the Council of Saint-Quentin in 1235 is that he forced ecclesiastics in his
court to prove by the duel their rights over their serfs—“Item, supplicat
concilium quod dominus rex non compellat personas ecclesiasticas probare
per duellum in curia sua homines quos dicunt suos esse de corpore suo”

Se ce est hors l’obeissance le Roy, gage de bataille (Étab. de St.

et s’il lor plest il le poent tenir selonc l’establissement le Roy” (Cout. du

chapters referred to the direction for the combat is absolute; no alternative
is provided, and there is no allusion to any difference of practice prevailing
in the royal courts and in those of the barons, such as may be seen in other
passages (Liv. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> chap. xxxviii. lxxxi. cxi. etc.). Yet in a charter of 1263,
Louis alludes to his having interdicted the duel in the domains of the crown

In Normandy, these advantages were enjoyed by all seigneurs justiciers.
“Tuit chevalier et tuit sergent ont en leurs terres leur justice de bataille en
cause citeaine; et quant li champions sera vaincuz, il auront LX sols et I
denier de la récréandise.”—Etab. de Normandie (Ed. Marnier, p. 30).
These minutely subdivided and parcelled out jurisdictions were one of the
most prolific causes of debate during the middle ages, not only on account
of the power and influence, but also from the profits derived from them.
That the privilege of decreeing duels was not the least remunerative of
these rights is well manifested by the decision of an inquest held during
the reign of Philip Augustus to determine the conflicting jurisdictions of the
ducal court of Normandy and of the seigneurs of Vernon. It will be
found quoted in full by Beugnot in his notes on the Olim, T. I. p. 969.

Recueil de Chants Historiques Français, I. 218. It is not unreasonable
to conjecture that these lines may have been occasioned by the
celebrated trial of Enguerrand de Coucy in 1256. On the plea of baronage,
he demanded trial by the Court of Peers, and claimed to defend himself
by the wager of battle. St. Louis proved that the lands held by Enguerrand
were not baronial, and resisted with the utmost firmness the pressure
of the nobles who made common cause with the culprit. On the condemnation
of de Coucy, the Count of Britanny bitterly reproached the king
with the degradation inflicted on his order by subjecting its members to inquest.—Beugnot,

I have not been able to find this Ordonnance. Laurière alludes to it
(Tabl. dés Ordonn. p. 59), but the passage of Du Cange which he cites
refers only to prohibition of tournaments. The catalogue of Pardessus and
the collection of Isambert contain nothing of the kind, but that some legislation
of this nature actually occurred is evident from the preamble to the
Ordonnance of 1306—“Savoir faisons que comme ça en arrière, pour le
commun prouffit de nostre royaume, nous eussions defendu généraument à
tous noz subgez toutes manieres de guerres et tous gaiges de batailles, etc.”
It is worthy of note that these ordonnances of Philippe were no longer
confined to the domain of the crown, but purported to regulate the customs
of the whole kingdom.</p></div>

<p>
Mr. Neilson draws (pp. 167, 168) a distinction, which is evidently correct,
between what he calls the chivalric duel, conducted by marshals and constables,
and the ordinary combat adjudged by the courts of law. The former
makes it appearance in the latter half of the fourteenth century, when the
common law duel was falling into desuetude. As we have seen above, a
somewhat similar development, though not so formally differentiated, is
traceable in France and Italy.</p></div>

Maitland’s Select Pleas of the Crown, I. 92. See Neilson, p. 154, for
an account of a savage combat in 1456 with an approver who had already
caused the hanging of several innocent men. In this case the judge laid
down the law that if the approver was vanquished the defendant must be
hanged for homicide. This strange ruling is not in accordance with earlier
practice. In 1220 an approver accuses seven persons, but is defeated in the
first combat and hanged, whereupon the accused are discharged on bail (Maitland,
Select Pleas, I. 123). See two other cases in the same year (Ibid. p. 133).</p></div>

ensued.</p></div>

This would seem to support the theory of Dr. Patetta (Ordalie, p. 13)
that the original form of the poison ordeals was the drinking of water in
which a fetish had been washed, the spirit of which was thus conveyed
into the person of the accused. On the other hand, there is the fact that
in some of the poison ordeals sickness was a proof of innocence.</p></div>

A scholiast on Horace, dating probably from the fifth century of our
era, describes an ordeal equivalent to the <i>judicium offæ</i>. When slaves,
he says, were suspected of theft they were taken before a priest who administered
to each a piece of bread over which certain conjurations had been
uttered and he who was unable to swallow it was adjudged guilty (Patetta,
I.e Ordalie, p. 140). Not only the date of this deprives it of value as evidence
of Roman custom, but also the fact that Romans might well employ
such means of influencing the imagination of Barbarian or ignorant slaves.</p></div>

has well exposed its improbability (Annali d’Italia, ann. 996); although
he had on a previous occasion argued in favor of its authenticity (Antiq.
Ital. Dissert. 38). In convicting the empress of calumny, the Countess of
Modena appeared as an accuser, making good the charge by the ordeal;
but if we look upon her as simply vindicating her husband’s character, the
case enters into the ordinary course of such affairs. Indeed, among the
Anglo-Saxons, there was a special provision by which the friends of an
executed criminal might clear his reputation by undergoing the triple ordeal,
after depositing pledges, to be forfeited in cases of defeat (Ethelred,
iii. § 6), just as in the burgher law of Northern Germany a relative of a
dead man might claim the duel to absolve him from an accusation (Sachsische
Weichbild, art. lxxxvii.). This was not mere sentiment, as in crimes
involving confiscation the estate of the dead man was at stake.</p></div>

The annalists of Trèves claim the merit of this for their archbishop Poppo,
whose pontificate lasted from 1016 to 1047. According to their legend,
Poppo not only drew on an iron gauntlet heated to redness, but entered a
fiery furnace clad only in a linen garment soaked in wax, which was consumed
by the flames without injury to him.—Gest. Trevir. Archiep. cap.

Somewhat similar was a volunteer ordeal related by Gregory of Tours,
when a Catholic disputing with an Arian threw his gold ring into the fire
and when heated to redness placed it in his palm with an adjuration to
God that if his faith was true it should not hurt him, which of course proved
to be the case.—Greg. Turon. de Gloria Confess, c. xiv.</p></div>

Raimond. de Agiles (Bongars, I. 150-168). The latter was chaplain of
the Count of Toulouse, and a firm asserter of the authenticity of the lance.
He relates with pride, that on its discovery he threw himself into the
trench and kissed it while the point only had as yet been uncovered. He
officiated likewise in the ordeal, and delivered the adjuration as Peter
entered the flames: “Si Deus omnipotens huic homini loquutus est facie
ad faciem, et beatus Andreas Lanceam Dominicam ostendit ei, cum ipse
vigilaret, transeat iste illæsus per ignem. Sin autem aliter est, et mendacium
est, comburatur iste cum lancea quam portabit in manibus suis.”
Raoul de Caen, on the other hand, in 1107 became secretary to the chivalrous
Tancred, and thus obtained his information from the opposite party.
He is very decided in his animadversions on the discoverers. Foulcher de
Chartres was chaplain to Baldwin I. of Jerusalem, and seems impartial,
though sceptical.
</p>
<p>
The impression made by the incident on the popular mind is manifested
in the fact that the Nürnberg Chronicle (fol. cxcv.) gives a veritable representation
of the lance-head.</p></div>

Arguments for its earlier use in Europe have been drawn from certain
miracles related by Gregory of Tours (Mirac. Lib. I. c. 69-70), but these
relate to innocent persons unjustly condemned to drowning, who were preserved,
and therefore these cases have no bearing on the matter. The
Epistle attributed by Gratian to Gregory I. (c. 7 § 1 Caus. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> q. v.), in
which the cold-water ordeal is alluded to, has long since been restored to its

We have seen above (p. 292), however, that this rule was by no means
invariable. In addition to the cases there adduced another may be cited
when in 1177 a citizen of London who is qualified as “nobilissimus et
ditissimus,” accused of robbery, was tried by the water ordeal, and on being
found guilty offered Henry II. five hundred marks for a pardon. The dazzling
bribe was refused, and he was duly hanged.—Gesta Henrici II. T. I.

(L. Longobard. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> Tit. xvi. § 2). The Anglo-Saxons (Æthelstan.

Not. ad Libb. Capit. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap. 103. This derives additional probability
from the text cited immediately above, relative to the substitution of
this ordeal for the duel, which is given by Eckhardt from an apparently
contemporary manuscript, and which, as we have seen, is attributed to
Louis le Débonnaire in the very year of the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle.
It is not a simple Capitulary, but an addition to the Salic Law, which
invests it with much greater importance. Lindenbruck (Cod. Legum
Antiq. p. 355) gives a different text, purporting likewise to be a supplement
to the Law, made in 816, which prescribes the duel in doubtful cases
between laymen, and orders the ordeal of the cross for ecclesiastical causes—“in
Ecclesiasticis autem negotiis, crucis judicio rei veritas inquiratur”—and
allows the same privilege to the “imbecillibus aut infirmis qui pugnare
non valent.” Baluze’s collection contains nothing of the kind as enacted
in 816, but under date of 819 there is a much longer supplement to the
Salic law, in which cap. x. presents the same general regulations, almost
verbatim, except that in ecclesiastical affairs the testimony of witnesses only
is alluded to, and the <i>judicium crucis</i> is altogether omitted. The whole
manifestly shows great confusion of legislation.</p></div>

This account, with unimportant variations, is given by Roger of Wendover,
ann. 1054, Matthew of Westminster, ann. 1054, the Chronicles of
Croyland, ann. 1053, Henry of Huntington, ann. 1053, and William of
Malmesbury, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> cap. 13, which shows that the legend was widely
spread and generally believed, although the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, ann.
1052, and Roger de Hoveden, ann. 1053, in mentioning Godwin’s death,
make no allusion to its being caused in this manner. A similar reticence
is observable in an anonymous Life of Edward (Harleian MSS. 526, p. 408
of the collection in M. R. Series), and although this is perhaps the best
authority we have for the events of his reign, still the author’s partiality for
the family of Godwin renders him not altogether beyond suspicion.
</p>
<p>
No great effort of scepticism is requisite to suggest that Edward, tired of
the tutelage in which he was held, may have made way with Godwin by
poison, and then circulated among a credulous generation the story related
by the annalists.</p></div>

When used for purposes of divining into the future, these practices
were forbidden. Thus, as early as 465, the Council of Vannes denounced
those who “sub nomine fictæ religionis quas sanctorum sortes vocant divinationis
scientiam profitentur, aut quarumcumque scripturarum inspectione
futura promittant,” and all ecclesiastics privy to such proceedings were to
be expelled from the church (Concil. Venet. can. xvi.). This canon is
repeated in the Council of Agde in 506, where the practice is denounced
as one “quod maxime fidem catholicæ religionis infestat” (Conc. Agathens.
can. xlii.); and a penitential of about the year 800 prescribes three years’
penitence for such acts.—Ghaerbaldi Judicia Sacerdotalia c. 29 (Martene

Carena, Tractatus de Officio Sanctiss. Inquisit. P. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> Tit. xii. § xxii.
In Carena’s first edition (Cremona, 1636) there is no allusion to the subject.
His attention apparently was attracted to it by a case occurring at
Cremona in 1636, where he was acting as criminal judge. In this, Gonsalvo
de Cremona, the clerical governor of Cremona, applied to the Council
of Milan in February for instructions and received an unsatisfactory reply.
He returned to the charge in June and was effectually snubbed by the following:—

his notes to the “Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.” In this the bone
chances to be fished up from a river, where it had lain for fifty years, and
the murderer, then an old man, happens to touch it, when it streams with
blood. He confesses the crime and is duly condemned.</p></div>

As late as 1678, an anonymous <i>Praxis Criminalis</i>, printed at Altenburg,
speaks of it as a recognized process, gives instructions as to the cautions
requisite, and says the record must be sent to the magistrate (Ib. c. i. § 11).—In
1714, Nehring (De Indiciis, Jenæ, 1714, pp. 42-3) still quotes
authorities in favor of its justifying torture, and feels obliged to argue at
some length to demonstrate its inadequacy.</p></div>

Constit. de Foresta § 11: “Sed purgatio ignis nullatenus admittatur nisi
ubi nuda veritas nequit aliter investigari.”—In the customs of Tournay in
1187, when a man has been wounded and has no witnesses the accused
can clear himself with six conjurators if the affair occurred in the daytime,
but if at night he is forced to the cold-water ordeal (Consuet. Tornacens.
§ ii. <i>ap.</i> D’Achery, Spicileg. III. 551). Horne’s Myrror of Justice, cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>

Yet in an English case of murder early in the thirteenth century, the accused
was found with the murdered man’s cap and the knife with which he had
been slain, and the whole vicinage testified to it, yet he was allowed to
purge himself with the water ordeal.—Maitland, Pleas, etc., p. 80.</p></div>

between the red-hot iron and a regular inquest—“Qui de palingis inpetitur,
si ad judicium ardentis ferri venire noluerit, veritatem comitis qualem
melius super hoc inveniri poterit, accipiet” (Warnkönig, Hist. de la Fland.

The law of William the Conqueror (Tit. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> c. 3.—Thorpe, I. 488) by
which the duel was reserved for the Norman, and the vulgar ordeal for the
Saxon, might be supposed to arise from a similar distinction. In reality,
however, it was only preserving the ancestral customs of the races, giving
to the defendant the privilege of his own law. The duel was unknown to
the Anglo-Saxons, who habitually employed the ordeal, while the Normans,
previous to the Conquest, according to Houard, who is good authority (Anc.
Loix Franc. I. 221-222), only appealed to the sword.</p></div>

The severity of the ordeal, when the sufferer had no friends among the
operators to save him, may be deduced from the description of a hand when
released from its three days’ tying up after its plunge in hot water: “inflatam
admodum et excoriatam sanieque jam carne putrida effluentem dexteram
invitus ostendit” (Du Cange, s. v. <i>Aquæ Ferv. Judicium</i>). In this
case, the sufferer was the adversary of an abbey, the monks of which perhaps
had the boiling of the caldron.</p></div>

This common sense view of the miracles so generally believed is the more
significant as coming from Frederic, who, a few years previously, was
ferociously vindicating with fire and sword the sanctity of the Holy Seamless

When, in 1692, Jacques Aymar attracted public attention to the miracles
of the diving-rod, he was called to Lyons to assist the police in
discovering the perpetrators of a mysterious murder, which had completely
baffled the agents of justice. Aided by his rod, he traced the criminals,
by land and water, from Lyons to Beaucaire, where he found in prison a
man whom he declared to be a participant, and who finally confessed the
crime. In 1703 Marshal Montrevel and the intendant Baville made use of
Aymar to discover Calvinists, of whom numbers were condemned on the
strength of his revelations (Patetta, Le Ordalie, p. 33). Aymar was at
length proved to be merely a clever charlatan, but the mania to which he
gave rise lasted through the eighteenth century, and nearly at its close his
wonders were rivalled by a brother sharper, Campetti. The belief in the
powers of the divining-rod has not yet died out, and it is frequently used to
discover oil wells, springs, mines, etc.
</p>
<p>
A good account of Aymar’s career and the discussion to which it gave
rise may be found in Prof. Rubio y Diaz’s “Estudios sobre la Evocacion
de los Espiritus,” Cadiz, 1860, pp. 116-28.</p></div>

See the translation of the Amherst Papyrus by Chabas, Mélanges Égyptologiques,
III.<sup>e</sup> Serie, T. II. p. 17 (Sept. 1873). The interpretation of the
groups relating to the hands and feet is conjectural, but they unquestionably
signify some kind of violence. M. Chabas qualifies this passage as highly
important, being the first evidence that has reached us of the judicial use
of torture in Egypt. The question has been a debated one, but the previous
evidence adduced was altogether inconclusive.</p></div>

1, 2, 3, 4, 5.—In a treaty between Childebert and Clotair, about the year
593, there is, however, a clause which would appear to indicate that in
doubtful cases slaves were subjected, not to torture, but to the ordeal of
chance. “Si servus in furto fuerit inculpatus, requiratur a domino ut ad
viginti noctes ipsum in mallum præsentet. Et si dubietas est, ad sortem
ponatur” (Pact. pro Tenore pacis cap. v.—Baluz.). This was probably
only a temporary international regulation to prevent frontier quarrels and
reprisals. That it had no permanent force of law is evident from the retention
of the procedures of torture in all the texts of the Salic law, including
the revision by Charlemagne.</p></div>

Under Charlemagne and Louis le Débonnaire seems to have commenced
the usage of holding the court under shelter. Thus Charlemagne,
“Ut in locis ubi mallus publicus haberi solet, tectum tale constituatur quod
in hiberno et in æstate observandus esse possit” (Capit. Carol. Mag. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>
ann. 809, § xiii.). See also Capit. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> eod. ann. § xxv. Louis le
Débonnaire prohibits the holding of courts in churches, and adds, “Volumus
utique ut domus a comite in locum ubi mallum teneri debet construatur ut
propter calorem solis et pluviam publica utilitas non remaneat” (Capit.
Ludov. Pii. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ann. 819, § xiv.).</p></div>

In 769, we find Charlemagne commanding the presence of all freemen
in the general judicial assembly held twice a year, “Ut ad mallum venire
nemo tardet, unum circa æstatem et alterum circa autumnum.” At others
of less importance, they were only bound to attend when summoned, “Ad
alia vero, si necessitas fuerit, vel denunciatio regis urgeat, vocatus venire
nemo tardet” (Capit. Carol. Mag. ann. 769, § xii.).
</p>
<p>
In 809, he desired that none should be forced to attend unless he had
business, “Ut nullus ad placitum venire cogatur, nisi qui caussam habet ad
quærendam” (Capit. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ann. 809, § xiii.).
</p>
<p>
In 819, Louis ordered, that the freemen should attend at least three
courts a year, “et nullus eos amplius placita observare compellat, nisi forte
quilibet aut accusatus fuerit, aut alium accusaverit, aut ad testimonium perhibendum
vocatus fuerit” (Capit. Ludov. Pii. <span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span> ann. 819, § xiv.).</p></div>

This right of appeal was not relished by the seigneurs, who apparently
foresaw that it might eventually become the instrument of their destruction.
It was long in establishing itself, and was resisted energetically. Thus the
Kings of England who were Dukes of Aquitaine, sometimes discouraged
the appeals of their French subjects to the courts of the King of France by
hanging the notaries who undertook to draw up the requisite papers.—Meyer,

Cæsarius of Heisterbach, writing in 1221, gives a story of an occurrence
happening in 1184 which, if not embellished by some later transcriber,
would seem to indicate that the judicial use of torture was known
at an earlier period than is stated in the text. A young girl, in the disguise
of a man, was despatched with letters to Lucius III. by the partisans of
Wolmar in his struggle with Rudolph for the bishopric of Trèves. Near
Augsburg she was joined by a robber, who, hearing his pursuers approaching,
gave her his bag to hold while he retired on some pretext to a thicket.
Captured with the stolen property she was condemned, but she told her
story to a priest in confession, the wood was surrounded and the robber
captured. He was tortured until he confessed the crime. Then he retracted,
and the question between the two was settled, at the suggestion of
the priest, by the ordeal of hot iron, when the robber’s hand was burnt, and
the girl’s uninjured. The tale is a long one, very romantic in its details,
and may very probably have been ornamented by successive scribes.—Cæsar.

likewise attributable another of the monstrous iniquities of criminal justice—the
denial to the accused of the assistance of counsel. Under the customary
law of the feudal courts, the avocat or “avantparlier” was freely admitted,
but such privilege was incompatible with the arbitrary process of which the
sole object was to condemn for a crime scarce susceptible of proof. The
decretal against heretics issued in 1235 by Gregory IX. forbids all judges,
advocates, and notaries from helping the suspected heretic under pain of
perpetual deprivation of function—“Item, judices, advocati, et notarii nulli
eorum officium suum impendant; alioquin eodem officio perpetuo sint privati”
(Harduin. Concil. VII. 164); and the same rule was enjoined “ne
Inquisitionis negotium per advocatorum strepitum retardetur” by the Council
of Valence (can. xi.) in 1248 and that of Alby (can. xxiii.) in 1254 (Harduin.

See the case of Berthaut Lestalon (Ibid. p. 501) accused of sundry
petty thefts and tortured unsuccessfully. The court decided that in view of
the little value of the articles stolen and of their having been recovered by
the owners, the prisoner should be tortured again, when, if he confessed,
he should be hanged, and if he still denied, he should have his right ear
cropped and be banished from Paris. This logical verdict was carried out.
No confession was obtained, and he was punished accordingly. Somewhat
similar was the case of Jehan de Warlus (Ibid. p. 157), who was punished
after being tortured five times without confession; also that of Jaquet de
Dun (Ibid. p. 494).</p></div>

In the Registre Criminel de St. Martin-des-Champs the cases are recorded
with too much conciseness to give details as to the process, only the
charge and the sentence being stated. It frequently happens, however,
that a man convicted of some petty larceny is stated to have confessed more
serious previous crimes, which necessarily implies their confession being extorted.
See, for instance, the case of Jehannin Maci, arrested in 1338 for
having in his possession two brass pots, the stealing of which he not only
confessed but also “plusures murtres et larrecins avoir fais” for which he
was duly drawn on a hurdle and hanged (<i>op. cit.</i> pp. 120-1). The
case of Phelipote de Monine (p. 178) is also suggestive.</p></div>

Ibid. I. 201-209.—Somewhat similar was the case of Marguerite de la
Pinele (Ibid. p. 322), accused of stealing a ring, which she confessed under
torture. As she did not, however, give a satisfactory account of some money
found upon her, though her story was partially confirmed by other evidence,
she was again twice tortured. This was apparently done to gratify the
curiosity of her judges, for, though no further confession was extracted from
her, she was duly buried alive.
</p>
<p>
Crimes for which a man was hanged or decapitated were punished in a
woman by burying or burning. Jews were executed by being hanged by
the heels between two large dogs suspended by the hind legs—a frightful
death, the fear of which sometimes produced conversion and baptism on the
gallows (Ibid. II. 43).</p></div>

Pauli Jovii Moschovia.—This is a brief account of Russia, compiled
about the year 1530, by Paulus Jovius, from his conversations with Dmitri,
ambassador to Clement VII. from Vasili V., first Emperor of Russia. Olaus
Magnus, in the pride of his Northern blood, looks upon the statement in the
text as a slander on the rugged Russ—“hoc scilicet pro terribili tormento
in ea durissima gente reputari, quæ flammis et eculeis adhibitis, vix, ut acta
revelet, tantillulum commovetur”—and he broadly hints that the wily ambassador
amused himself by hoaxing the soft Italian: “Sed revera vel ludibriose
bonus præsul a versuto Muscovitici principis nuntio Demetrio dicto,
tempore Clementis VII. informatus est Romæ” (Gent. Septent. Hist. Brev.
Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XI.</span> c. xxvi.). The worthy archbishop doubtless spoke of his own
knowledge with respect to the use of the rack and fire in Russia, but the
contempt he displays for the torture of a stream of water is ill-founded. In
our prisons the punishment of the shower-bath is found to bring the most
refractory characters to obedience in an incredibly short time, and its unjustifiable
severity in a civilized age like this may be estimated from the fact
that it has occasionally resulted in the death of the patient. Thus, at the
New York State Prison at Auburn, in December, 1858, a strong, healthy
man, named Samuel Moore, was kept in the shower-bath from a half to
three-quarters of an hour, and died almost immediately after being taken
out. A less inhumane mode of administering the punishment is to wrap
the patient in a blanket, lay him on his back, and, from a height of about
six feet, pour upon his forehead a stream from an ordinary watering-pot
without the rose. According to experts, this will make the stoutest criminal
beg for his life in a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
During the later period of our recent war, when the prevalence of exaggerated
bounties for recruits led to an organized system of desertion, the
magnitude of the evil seemed to justify the adoption of almost any means
to arrest a practice which threatened rapidly to exhaust the resources of
the country. Accordingly, the shower-bath was occasionally put into requisition
by the military authorities to extort confession from suspected deserters,
when legal evidence was not attainable, and it was found exceedingly
efficacious.</p></div>

Ordonnance, Mars 1498, §§ 110-116 (Isambert, XI. 365.—Fontanon,
I. 710). It would seem that the only torture contemplated by this ordonnance
was that of water, as the clerk is directed to record “la quantité de
l’eau qu’on aura baillée audit prisonnier.” This was administered by gagging
the patient, and pouring water down his throat until he was enormously
distended. It was sometimes diversified by making him eject the water
violently, by forcible blows on the stomach (Fortescue de Laudibus Legg.
Angliæ, cap. xxii.). Sometimes a piece of cloth was used to conduct the
water down his throat. To this, allusion is made in the “Appel de
Villon”:—

Isambert, XIV. 88. Beccaria comments on the absurdity of such proceedings,
as though a man who had accused himself would make any difficulty
in accusing others.—“Quasi che l’uomo che accusa sè stesso, non
accusi più facilmente gli altri. E egli giusto il tormentare gli uomini per
l’altrui delitto?”—Dei Delitte e delle Pene, § <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> A curious illustration
of its useless cruelty when applied to prisoners of another stamp is afforded
by the record of a trial which occurred at Rouen in 1647. A certain Jehan
Lemarinier, condemned to death for murder, was subjected to the <i>question
définitive</i>. Cords twisted around the fingers, scourging with rods, the
strappado with fifty pounds attached to each foot, the thumbscrew were
applied in succession and together, without eliciting anything but fervent
protestations of innocence. The officials at last wearied out remanded
the convict to prison, when he sent for them and quietly detailed all the
particulars of his crime, committed by himself alone, requesting especially
that they should record his confession as having been spontaneous, for the
relief of his conscience, and not extorted by torment.—Desmaze, Les
Pénalités Anciennes, p. 159, Paris, 1866.</p></div>

Heineccii Hist. Jur. Civ. Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> §§ cv. sqq.—Meyer (Instit. Judiciaires,
Liv. <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> chap. xi.) gives a very interesting sketch of the causes which
led to the overthrow of the old system of jurisprudence throughout Germany.
He attributes it to the influence of the emperors and the municipalities,
each equally jealous of the authority of the feudal nobles, aided by the
lawyers, now becoming a recognized profession. These latter of course
favored a jurisprudence which required long and special training, thus conferring
upon them as a class peculiar weight and influence.</p></div>

My principal authorities are:—
</p>
<p>
Rerum Criminalium Praxis, by Josse Damhouder, a lawyer and statesman
of repute in Flanders, where he held a distinguished position under
Charles V. and Philip II. His work was received as an authority throughout
Europe for two centuries, having passed through numerous editions,
from that of Louvain, in 1554, to that of Antwerp, in 1750. My edition is
of Antwerp, 1601.
</p>
<p>
Tractatus de Quæstionibus seu Torturis Reorum, published in 1592 by
Johann Zanger, of Wittenberg, a celebrated jurisconsult of the time, and
frequently reprinted. My edition is that of 1730, with notes by the learned
Baron Senckenberg, and there is a still later one, published at Frankfort in
1763.
</p>
<p>
Practica Criminalis, seu Processus Judiciarius ad usum et consuetudinem
judiciorum in Germania hoc tempore frequentiorem, by Johann Emerich von
Rosbach, published in 1645 at Frankfort on the Mayn.
</p>
<p>
Tractatio Juridica, de Usu et Abusu Torturæ, by Heinrich von Boden, a
dissertation read at Halle in 1697, and reprinted by Senckenberg in 1730,
in conjunction with the treatise of Zanger.

de Nobilitate” (Campodun. 1693), while endeavoring to exalt to the utmost
the privileges of the nobility, both of the sword and robe, is obliged
to admit their liability to torture for these crimes, and only urges that the
preliminary proof should be stronger than in the case of plebeians (Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>
cap. iv. Nos. 108-120); though, in other accusations, a judge subjecting a
noble to torture should be put to death, and his attempt to commit such an
outrage could be resisted by force of arms (Ibid. No. 103). He adds,
however, that no special privileges existed in France, Lombardy, Venice,
Italy, and Saxony (Ibid. Nos. 105-7). Scialoja expressly says (Praxis
c. xiii. Nos. 40-49, 55) that in Naples no dignity, secular or ecclesiastical,
except that of judges, conferred immunity from torture; and all privileges
were set aside by a direct order from the sovereign.</p></div>

he advocated its use, and he only deplored the excessive abuse of it by the

So thoroughly was this recognized, that in 1668 Racine represents a

to her the spectacle of the question as an agreeable pastime.

Fortescue, in his arguments against the use of torture, does not fail to
recognize that the acquittal of a tortured prisoner is the condemnation of the
judge—“qui judex eum pronuntiet innocentem, nonne eodem judicio judex
ille seipsum reum judicat omnis sævitiæ et pœnarum quibus innocentem
afflixit?”—De Laud. Legg. Angl. cap. xxii.</p></div>

Quoted by Nicolas, Diss. Mor. et Jurid. sur la Torture, p. 21. This
mode of torture consisted in placing the accused between two jailers, who
pummelled him whenever he began to doze, and thus, with proper relays,
deprived him of sleep for forty hours. Its inventor considered it humane,
as it endangered neither life nor limb, but the extremity of suffering to
which it reduced the prisoner is shown by its efficaciousness.
</p>
<p>
Marsigli received much credit for this ingenious invention. Grillandus
informs us that he experimented with it in a difficult case of two monks
“et profecto vidi ea quæ prius non credebam, quod illud affert maximum
tormentum et fastidium in corpore absque aliqua membrorum læsione.”—Grillandi
de Quæstione et Tortura Art. ii.

I have purposely abstained from entering into the details of the various
forms of torture. They may be interesting to the antiquarian, but they
illustrate no principle, and little would be gained by describing these melancholy
monuments of human error. Those who may be curious in such
matters will find ample material in Grupen Observat. Jur. Crim. de Applicat.
Torment., 4to., Hanov. 1754; Zangeri <i>op. cit.</i> cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> Nos. 9, 10;
Hieron. Magius de Equuleo cum Appendd. Amstelod. 1664, etc. According
to Bernhardi, Johann Graefe enumerates no less than six hundred different
instruments invented for the purpose. Damhouder (<i>op. cit.</i> cap.
xxxvii. Nos. 17-23) declares that torture can legally be inflicted only with
ropes, and then proceeds to describe a number of ingenious devices. One
of these, which he states to produce insufferable torment without risk, is
bathing the feet with brine and then setting a goat to lick the soles.
</p>
<p>
The strappado, or suspension by the arms behind the back with weights
to the feet, was the torture in most general use and most favored by legal
experts.—Grillandus, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>

How exceedingly lax was the application of these rules may be guessed
from a remark of Damhouder’s, that although rumor was sufficient to justify
torture, yet a contrary rumor neutralized the first and rendered torture improper.—Damhouder.

Bernhardi, <i>loc. cit.</i> The difference between the practice and principles
of the law is shown by the rules laid down in 1647 by Brunnemann,
coexisting with the above. He directs that the proceedings are to be exhibited
to the accused or his friends, and then submitted to a college of
jurists who are to decide as to the necessity of torture, and he warns the
latter that they can have no graver question placed before them—“Et sane
nullam graviorem puto esse deliberationem in Collegiis Juridicis quam ubi
de tortura infligenda agitur.”—Brunneman. de Inquisitionis Processu cap.

if he shed no tears during the torture, and if he recovered speedily after
each application—he was not to be liberated because no confession could be

In the middle of the thirteenth century, the Emperor Theodore Lascaris
invented a novel mode of torture in a case of this kind. When a noble
lady of his court was accused of sorcery, he caused her to be inclosed
naked in a sack with a number of cats. The suffering, though severe,
failed to extort a confession.—Georg. Pachymeri Hist. Mich. Palæol. Lib.

Sprenger Mall. Maleficar. P. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> q. xvi. This was directly in contradiction
to the precepts of the civil lawyers. Ippolito dei Marsigli says positively
that a confession uttered in response to a promise of pardon cannot be used
against the accused (Singularia, Venet. 1555, fol. 36 <i>b</i>). The Church, however,
did not consider itself bound by the ordinary rules of law or morality.
Marsigli in another passage (fol. 30 <i>a</i>) relates that Alexander III. once
secretly promised a bishop that if he would publicly confess himself guilty
of simony he should have a dispensation, and on the prelate’s doing so,
immediately deposed him.</p></div>

A curious disregard of this principle occurs in the Welsh laws, which
provide that when a thief is at the gallows, with the certainty of being
hanged, his testimony as to his accomplices is to be received as sufficient
without requiring it to be sworn to on a relic—the inseparable condition of
all other evidence. By a singular inconsistency, however, the accomplice
thus convicted was not to be hanged, but to be sold as a slave.—Dimetian
Code, Bk. II. ch. v. § 9 (Owen I. 425).</p></div>

Many interesting details on the influence of the Roman law upon that
of England will be found in the learned work of Carl Güterbock, “Bracton
and his Relation to the Roman Law,” recently translated by Brinton
Coxe (Philadelphia, 1866). The subject is one which well deserves a
more thorough consideration than it is likely to receive at the hands of
English writers.

It is curious to observe that the <i>crimen læsæ majestatis</i> makes its appearance
in Bracton (Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Tract. ii. cap. 3, § 1) about the middle of the
thirteenth century, earlier than in France, where, as we have seen, the
first allusion to it occurs in 1315. This was hardly to be expected, when
we consider the widely different influences exerted upon the jurisprudence
of the two countries by the Roman law.</p></div>

The passage which has been relied on by lawyers is chap. xxx.:
“Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut dissaisiatur, aut utlagetur,
aut aliquo modo destruatur; nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum
mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ.”
If the law just above quoted from the collection of Henry I. could be
supposed to be still in force under John, then this might possibly be imagined
to bear some reference to it; but it is evident that had torture been
an existing grievance, such as outlawry, seizure, and imprisonment, the barons
would have been careful to include it in their enumeration of restrictions.
Moreover, Magna Charta was specially directed to curtail the royal prerogative,
and at a later period was not held by any one to interfere with that
prerogative whenever the king desired to test with the rack the endurance
of his loving subjects.</p></div>

Pike (Hist. of Crime in England I. 427) quotes a document of 1189
which seems indirectly to show that torture could be inflicted under an
order of the king. The expression is somewhat doubtful, and as torture
had not yet established itself anywhere in Europe as a judicial procedure
the document alleged can hardly be received as evidence of its legality.</p></div>

Sir William Skevington, a lieutenant of the Tower, under Henry VIII.,
immortalized himself by reviving an old implement of torture, consisting of
an iron hoop, in which the prisoner was bent, heels to hams and chest to
knees, and was thus crushed together unmercifully. It obtained the nickname
of Skevington’s Daughter, corrupted in time to Scavenger’s Daughter.
Among other sufferers from its embraces was an unlucky Irishman, named
Myagh, whose plaint, engraved on the walls of his dungeon, is still among
the curiosities of the Tower:—

</p>
<p>
It is rather remarkable to find torture legalized at this period, even in
qualified form of the <i>question définitive</i> in the Colony of Massachusetts.
The Body of Liberties, enacted in 1641, declares:—
</p>
<p>
“45. No man shall be forced by Torture to confesse any crime against
himselfe nor any other, unlesse it be in some Capitall case where he is first
fully convicted by cleare and suffitient evidence to be guilty, After which if
the case be of that nature, That it is very apparent there be other conspiritours
or confederates with him, Then he may be tortured, yet not with
such Tortures as be Barbarous and inhumane.”—Whitmore’s Colonial
Laws of Massachusetts, Boston, 1889 (N. Y. Nation, No. 1268, p. 318).
</p>
<p>
From this it would appear safe to conclude that this is a limitation on a
pre-existing, more general use of torture.</p></div>

of fifty years, fell under suspicion. “The unhappy old man was kept

I quote from Mr. Lecky (p. 147), who gives as his authority “Pitcairn’s
Criminal Trials of Scotland.”
</p>
<p>
“But others and perhaps worse trials were in reserve. The three principal
that were habitually applied were the penniwinkis, the boots, and the
caschielawis. The first was a kind of thumbscrew; the second was a frame
in which the leg was inserted, and in which it was broken by wedges driven
in by a hammer; the third was also an iron frame for the leg, which was
from time to time heated over a brazier. Fire matches were sometimes
applied to the body of the victim. We read, in a contemporary legal
register, of one man who was kept for forty-eight hours in ‘vehement
tortour’ in the caschielawis; and of another who remained in the same
frightful machine for eleven days and eleven nights, whose legs were broken
daily for fourteen days in the boots, and who was so scourged that the whole
skin was torn from his body.” These cases occurred in 1596.
</p>
<p>
These horrors are almost equalled by those of another trial in which a
Dr. Fian was accused of having caused the storms which endangered the
voyage of James VI. from Denmark in 1590. James personally superintended
the torturing of the unhappy wretch, and after exhausting all the
torments known to the skill and experience of the executioners, he invented
new ones. All were vain, however, and the victim was finally burnt without
confessing his ill-deeds (Ibid. p. 123).</p></div>

7 Anne c. 21.—While thus legislating for the enlightenment of Scotland,
the English majority took care to retain the equally barbarous practice
of the <i>peine forte et dure</i>. This was commenced in 1275 simply as a
“prisone forte et dure” (First Statute of Westminster, cap. xii.; Cf. Britton,
cap. xi.) for felons refusing to plead, and speedily developed into starvation
and nakedness (Fleta, Lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> cap. xxxii. § 33). Horne (Myrror of Justice,
cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> § viii.; cap. <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> § ix.) evidently regards as illegal “le horrible et
perillous lien,” and treats as murder a death occasioned by it. In spite of
this protest the process was rendered still more barbarous by piling weights
of iron on the poor wretch, and finally the device of a press was adopted
in which he was squeezed. In this shape it lost its original justification of
wearing out his endurance and forcing him to plead either guilty or not
guilty, and became a simple punishment of peculiar atrocity, for, after its
commencement the prisoner was not allowed to plead, but was kept under
the press until death, “donec oneris, frigoris atque famis cruciatu extinguitur”
(Hale, Placit. Coron. c. xliii.). This relic of modern barbarism was
not abolished until 1772, by 12 Geo. III. c. 20. The only case of its employment
in America is said to have been that of Giles Cory, in 1692, during
the witchcraft epidemic. Knowing the hopelessness of the trials, he refused
to plead, and was duly pressed to death (Cobbett’s State Trials, VI. 680).
</p>
<p>
When the <i>peine forte et dure</i> had become simply a punishment, it was
sometimes replaced by a torture consisting of tying the thumbs together
with whipcord until the endurance of the accused gave way and he consented
to plead. This practice continued at least until so late as 1734.
See an interesting essay by Prof. James B. Thayer, Harvard Law Review,
Jan. 1892.</p></div>

on the subject, in order that the reform may embody the results of public
opinion—“Nous élèverons ainsi au rang des lois les résultats de l’opinion
publique.” This was pure democratic republicanism in an irregular form.

<p>
The edict also indicates an intention to remove another of the blots on
the criminal procedure of the age, in a vague promise to allow the prisoner
the privilege of counsel.</p></div>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
